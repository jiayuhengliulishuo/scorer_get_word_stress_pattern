mp3/50d41521fcfff2ec2e0000a8.mp3,with my boyfriend jake and his friend i think it'll be good for lin lin to go out and meet some new people
mp3/50d41521fcfff2ec2e0000aa.mp3,to dinner and a movie very casual and harmless it'll be fun
mp3/50d41521fcfff2ec2e0000ab.mp3,i wonder if lin lin understands the concept of causal dating

mp3/50d425c7fcfff2ec2e0000b2.mp3,yeah did he say it's not you it's me
mp3/50d425c7fcfff2ec2e0000b3.mp3,yes those exact words how did you know
mp3/50d425c7fcfff2ec2e0000b4.mp3,it's a break up cliche any guy who doesn't know what to say to a sad girl will say it
mp3/50d425c7fcfff2ec2e0000b5.mp3,well no matter what he said he dumped me
mp3/50d425c7fcfff2ec2e0000b6.mp3,give yourself time it'll get better

mp3/50d42ae3fcfff2ec2e0000bb.mp3,yeah in america you can go out just for fun you don't always have to really like someone to go out with them
mp3/50d42ae3fcfff2ec2e0000bc.mp3,that is so unusual megan has had three boyfriends and has gone out with twenty men
mp3/50d42ae3fcfff2ec2e0000bd.mp3,right that's common in america we know that you might not really hit it off with the first person you date

mp3/50d42f2cfcfff2eebd00000a.mp3,hey now not all men are like that to say that all men are cheaters is unfair
mp3/50d42f2cfcfff2eebd00000b.mp3,yeah you're right i just hate that it happens at all
mp3/50d42f2cfcfff2eebd00000c.mp3,i agree with you completely just remember that there are a lot of good men like me

mp3/50e577dcfcfff2ab3c00002f.mp3,well i cut the coupon out of the newspaper and the next time i go to the grocery store i can get that discount on that item
mp3/50e577dcfcfff2ab3c000030.mp3,is this why we have fifteen boxes of toilet paper in the garage
mp3/50e577dcfcfff2ab3c000031.mp3,john they were on sale you know i can't pass up a bargain like that
mp3/50e577dcfcfff2ab3c000032.mp3,i know that i can't pass by to get to my car because of all the boxes in my way

mp3/50e6ef28fcfff21877000009.mp3,because i overheard her say that she liked guys with biceps
mp3/50e6ef28fcfff2187700000a.mp3,what are you talking about i'm going because it's getting too cold to exercise outside it's only forty degrees out there
mp3/50e6ef28fcfff2187700000b.mp3,that's true what do you do with the gym
mp3/50e6ef28fcfff2187700000c.mp3,i use the elliptical every time and then two days a week i also lift irons she said she likes biceps huh
mp3/50e6ef28fcfff2187700000e.mp3,good to know maybe i'll add some curls

mp3/50e93aa5fcfff2f7ad000006.mp3,i couldn't think of any so i told her the boston marathon
mp3/50e93aa5fcfff2f7ad000007.mp3,seriously that is too funny you have to get a three o five in another marathon to qualify for that race
mp3/50e93aa5fcfff2f7ad000008.mp3,ah i really am a dumbass what should i do
mp3/50e940a4fcfff2d76b000002.mp3,hey tom i didn't see you at the softball game last night
mp3/50e940a4fcfff2d76b000003.mp3,oh hey melanie yeah i couldn't make it
mp3/50e940a4fcfff2d76b000007.mp3,oh yeah well not too good i pulled my hamstring
mp3/50e940a4fcfff2d76b000008.mp3,oh no i'm really sorry does it hurt a lot
mp3/50e940a4fcfff2d76b000009.mp3,yeah i haven't been able to run on it so i might not be able to do the boston marathon
mp3/50e940a4fcfff2d76b00000a.mp3,i have a friend who's a personal trainer she runs triathlons i can ask her to take a look at your leg
mp3/50e940a4fcfff2d76b00000b.mp3,no i mean she doesn't need to i just need to ice it
mp3/50e940a4fcfff2d76b00000c.mp3,it's really no problem she helped me when i strained my back last year
mp3/50e940a4fcfff2d76b00000d.mp3,i can take care of it myself
mp3/50e940a4fcfff2d76b00000e.mp3,oh ok well talk to you later

mp3/50e94596fcfff2b0b3000005.mp3,yeah it's awkward now i have to keep pretending to limp
mp3/50e94596fcfff2b0b3000006.mp3,it's warm enough to run outside now and i'd much rather run outside than on a treadmill
mp3/50e94596fcfff2b0b3000007.mp3,why do you like running outside so much
mp3/50e94596fcfff2b0b3000008.mp3,it's more fun when you can people watch
mp3/50e94596fcfff2b0b300000b.mp3,that sounds intense but also like a great way to start your day
mp3/51063261fcfff27e6200063c.mp3,do you want to come with me sometime
mp3/51063261fcfff27e6200063e.mp3,around seven a m too early
mp3/50e94bfffcfff2d76b000011.mp3,thanks for coming running with me tom
mp3/50e94bfffcfff2d76b000012.mp3,no problem it helps to have an exercise partner knowing i need to meet someone gives me an extra burst of motivation
mp3/50e94bfffcfff2d76b000013.mp3,i totally know what you mean the hardest part is getting out of bed
mp3/50e94bfffcfff2d76b000014.mp3,are you ever afraid running by yourself
mp3/50e94bfffcfff2d76b000015.mp3,sometimes running alone in the early morning or late at night means you have to be extra alert
mp3/50e94bfffcfff2d76b000017.mp3,i usually don't wear my headphones and i'm always scanning my path i also keep my hair in a bun so it's harder to grab
mp3/50e94bfffcfff2d76b000018.mp3,i'm sorry you have to worry about stuff like that
mp3/51065393fcfff27e62000641.mp3,remind me never to jump out and surprise you
mp3/51065393fcfff27e62000642.mp3,good idea it'll take you a few days to recover from wherever i punch you
mp3/50ebdf81fcfff2c3e3000036.mp3,have you bought all the supplies for your house party tomorrow
mp3/50ebdf81fcfff2c3e3000037.mp3,i have to get a few more things do you think you can help me out
mp3/50ebdf81fcfff2c3e3000038.mp3,sure what do you need me to pick up
mp3/50ebdf81fcfff2c3e3000039.mp3,i need you to pick up some beer from the liquor store the cheap stuff too
mp3/50ebdf81fcfff2c3e300003a.mp3,okay i'll get some coors light and budweiser cheap and always reliable is there anything else i need to get
mp3/50ebdf81fcfff2c3e300003c.mp3,remember the last game we played you sank that cup with your eyes closed
mp3/50ebdf81fcfff2c3e300003d.mp3,oh man that was probably the shot of my life remember that time you made the shot off the wall and between the legs
mp3/50ebdf81fcfff2c3e300003e.mp3,oh yeah that was the shot of my life
mp3/50ebdf81fcfff2c3e300003f.mp3,good times we'll definitely have to play some beer pong tonight
mp3/50ec1202fcfff2f922000031.mp3,are you coming to joe's surprise party
mp3/50ec1202fcfff2f922000032.mp3,yeah i will be he doesn't suspect anything right
mp3/50ec1202fcfff2f922000033.mp3,nah i don't think so i had to delete my text messages to everyone who was coming in case he saw them by accident
mp3/50ec1202fcfff2f922000034.mp3,i just picked up the cake so i'll give it to the waiters beforehand
mp3/50ec1202fcfff2f922000035.mp3,thanks make sure you get there early so that joe doesn't see you by accident
mp3/50ec1202fcfff2f922000036.mp3,it's the party room at jack astor's right
mp3/50ec1202fcfff2f922000037.mp3,yup they let us bring in thirty people instead of twenty five
mp3/50ec1202fcfff2f922000038.mp3,wow i'm surprised that they let you do that isn't it some sort of safety violation to allow that many people
mp3/50ec1202fcfff2f922000039.mp3,yeah but we're going to order drinks and a ton of food so i guess it's worth it for them
mp3/50ec1202fcfff2f92200003a.mp3,true true not going to lie i love their nachos
mp3/50ec1202fcfff2f92200003c.mp3,you know it anyways i gotta go i'll see you tonight
mp3/50ec1bbefcfff2c3e3000041.mp3,are you still coming over tonight
mp3/50ec1bbefcfff2c3e3000043.mp3,i don't know it was your idea i guess just go invite the usual people
mp3/50ec1bbefcfff2c3e3000044.mp3,okay i'll call up frankie tim courtney and loretta
mp3/50ec1bbefcfff2c3e3000045.mp3,sounds good what are we going to do tonight
mp3/50ec1bbefcfff2c3e3000046.mp3,probably the usual stuff chill watch tv maybe some board games too
mp3/50ec1bbefcfff2c3e3000047.mp3,all right i think tim got a new board game so we can play that
mp3/50ec1bbefcfff2c3e3000048.mp3,yeah sounds good i'm going to stop by the grocery store on the way over should i pick up some food
mp3/50ec1bbefcfff2c3e3000049.mp3,good idea i'm really low on junk food can you get some chips and snacks
mp3/50ec1bbefcfff2c3e300004a.mp3,i think i'm going to make some guacamole at your place too do you have any of the guacamole ingredients
mp3/50ec1bbefcfff2c3e300004b.mp3,i have onions garlic salt and pepper
mp3/50ec1bbefcfff2c3e300004c.mp3,ok so that means i have to go get avocados limes tomatoes and some jalapenos
mp3/50ec1bbefcfff2c3e300004d.mp3,and nachos don't forget the nachos
mp3/50ec1bbefcfff2c3e300004e.mp3,that's the most important part definitely won't forget those
mp3/50ec231efcfff2c3e3000050.mp3,so who did you get for secret santa this year
mp3/50ec231efcfff2c3e3000051.mp3,i can't tell you that would ruin the game

mp3/50ec231efcfff2c3e3000056.mp3,not this year i got anthony this year it's funny because i got him last year too
mp3/50ec231efcfff2c3e3000057.mp3,what a coincidence what are you planning to get him
mp3/50ec231efcfff2c3e3000058.mp3,our price limit was twenty dollars so i think i'm going to get him a u s b key for his key chain it's practical and looks nice
mp3/50ec231efcfff2c3e3000059.mp3,wow that's a good idea i kind of wish you got me now i need a u s b key too
mp3/50ec231efcfff2c3e300005a.mp3,well if your secret santa reveals his or herself to me i'll be sure to let them know

mp3/50ec29fafcfff27b4800002f.mp3,i'm not surprised you drank so much last night
mp3/50ec29fafcfff27b48000030.mp3,it's a good thing we rented a hotel room so no one had to drive home
mp3/50ec29fafcfff27b48000031.mp3,yeah i've been up for a while frankie tim and courtney are still passed out over there
mp3/50ec29fafcfff27b48000032.mp3,you were the first one up when did you wake up
mp3/50ec29fafcfff27b48000033.mp3,oh about thirty minutes ago i never sleep well after a night of drinking
mp3/50ec29fafcfff27b48000034.mp3,that's so weird you'd think you would be able to sleep well after such a long night
mp3/50ec29fafcfff27b48000035.mp3,yeah it really sucks i'm so hungry though you want to wake up the others and go grab some breakfast
mp3/50ec29fafcfff27b48000036.mp3,yes a greasy breakfast is the best post hangover breakfast
mp3/50ec29fafcfff27b48000037.mp3,okay then go wake them up and let's go get some food
mp3/50ec2f19fcfff2f69500005f.mp3,are you going to jessica's potluck on friday night
mp3/50ec2f19fcfff2f695000060.mp3,friday night i thought it was on saturday night
mp3/50ec2f19fcfff2f695000061.mp3,no it's definitely friday night i just checked the face book event
mp3/50ec2f19fcfff2f695000062.mp3,good thing you told me then i might have shown up at her place with a huge plate of spaghetti
mp3/50ec2f19fcfff2f695000063.mp3,no way i'm bringing spaghetti too
mp3/50ec2f19fcfff2f695000064.mp3,wait we can't bring the same thing that's so lame
mp3/50ec2f19fcfff2f695000065.mp3,okay well it only makes sense for the better cook to bring the spaghetti so i'll make sure to bring it
mp3/50ec2f19fcfff2f695000066.mp3,well you sure are humble aren't you i guess i'll bring something boring like fruit salad
mp3/50ec2f19fcfff2f695000067.mp3,you could spice it up and bring potato salad that's always a safe potluck choice
mp3/50ec2f19fcfff2f695000068.mp3,i'm going to bring lasagna everyone knows that lasagna is better than spaghetti
mp3/50ec2f19fcfff2f695000069.mp3,so it's spaghetti versus lasagna time to see which pasta reigns supreme
mp3/50ecdaa3fcfff2f922000068.mp3,hey hurry up we're going to be late
mp3/50ecdaa3fcfff2f922000069.mp3,well we would be on time if you didn't burn your dish
mp3/50ecdaa3fcfff2f92200006a.mp3,it was a new recipe and i ran out of butter and my oven broke so shut up
mp3/50ecdaa3fcfff2f92200006b.mp3,you know you don't have to be so bitter my spaghetti will cover up your failed lasagna
mp3/50ecdaa3fcfff2f92200006c.mp3,yeah well we're gonna be late so i hope all the food isn't gone
mp3/50ecdaa3fcfff2f92200006d.mp3,i called ahead already and told them we're going to be late
mp3/50ecdaa3fcfff2f92200006e.mp3,oh nice i think kevin said he brought garlic bread that's going to go so well with the spaghetti
mp3/50ecdaa3fcfff2f92200006f.mp3,i just hope that his bread isn't as burnt as your lasagna
mp3/50ecdaa3fcfff2f922000070.mp3,you are not a very nice person
mp3/50ecdaa3fcfff2f922000071.mp3,i'm just kidding i'm sure it'll taste fine once you get past the cancer inducing burnt parts
mp3/50ecdaa3fcfff2f922000072.mp3,you are not a very nice person and i hate you
mp3/50ece8abfcfff2f922000074.mp3,this has got to be the greatest breakfast ever where did you find this place
mp3/50ece8abfcfff2f922000075.mp3,this is where i always go after a night of drinking their home fries are so greasy
mp3/50ece8abfcfff2f922000076.mp3,yeah and this bacon is so crispy never had bacon this crispy before
mp3/50ece8abfcfff2f922000078.mp3,i got the lumberjack's breakfast it has pancakes toast bacon sausage six eggs and home fries
mp3/50ece8abfcfff2f922000079.mp3,can you actually finish all of that that would last me for the whole day
mp3/50ece8abfcfff2f92200007a.mp3,this is a champion's breakfast i wish i could eat this every day
mp3/50ece8abfcfff2f92200007b.mp3,if you ate this everyday you would be so fat and you'd probably have seven heart attacks by now
mp3/50ece8abfcfff2f92200007d.mp3,i guess it depends on your point of view do you value your health or your stomach more
mp3/50ece8abfcfff2f92200007e.mp3,i guess my health i'll try to be healthier
mp3/50ed0672fcfff27b4800004b.mp3,by the way did you see my awesome dance moves last night
mp3/50ed0672fcfff27b4800004c.mp3,are you talking about that little seizure you had in the middle of the dance floor
mp3/50ed0672fcfff27b4800004d.mp3,you obviously don't know the latest dance moves
mp3/50ed0672fcfff27b4800004e.mp3,no i'm pretty sure i do do you know that you accidently knocked a girl out on the dance floor last night
mp3/50ed0672fcfff27b4800004f.mp3,oh that explains the bruise on your knee
mp3/50ed0672fcfff27b48000050.mp3,yeah it was my fault to be honest i need to look out for dangerous dancers
mp3/50ed0672fcfff27b48000051.mp3,don't hate on my inner creativity i watched a lot of seventy's disco movies
mp3/50ed0672fcfff27b48000052.mp3,you need to be watching some more current movies
mp3/50ed0672fcfff27b48000053.mp3,i'll just watch some music channels on tv that should help
mp3/50ed0672fcfff27b48000054.mp3,just keep your arms and legs close together and move to the beat dancing is not hard

mp3/50ed7c40fcfff2f922000083.mp3,well it's really freakin smoky in there which makes it super difficult to breathe whenever i leave i smell disgusting
mp3/50ed7c40fcfff2f922000085.mp3,yeah so i still go cuz dancing is my favorite part of clubbing however i always like breathing
mp3/50ed7c40fcfff2f922000086.mp3,well it's so close we don't even need a taxi do you wanna go with me tonight and just try it

mp3/50ffb148fcfff27e620000e5.mp3,i guess you won't be drinking any chocolate milk then
mp3/50ffb148fcfff27e620000e6.mp3,huh chocolate milk why would i want some chocolate milk
mp3/50ffb148fcfff27e620000e7.mp3,i read that chocolate milk helps to rebuild your muscles after you exercise it's supposed to really help

mp3/50ffb148fcfff27e620000e9.mp3,yeah just don't drink too much of it or else you'll go from just barely overweight back to overweight
mp3/50ffb35ffcfff27e620000eb.mp3,holy crap i didn't know this video had so many views it has hundreds of millions on this website alone
mp3/50ffb35ffcfff27e620000ec.mp3,so many videos came up it looks like everybody and their brother have all done parodies of it
mp3/50ffb35ffcfff27e620000ed.mp3,really let's see ohio state marching band does gangnam style oregon state gangnam style
mp3/50ffb35ffcfff27e620000ee.mp3,you know those filipino prison inmates who dance to all those other popular songs
mp3/50ffb35ffcfff27e620000f1.mp3,i've heard that even groups of chinese middle school students get together and do it for their daily exercise
mp3/50ffb35ffcfff27e620000f2.mp3,geez that girl hyuna from the video even made her own version of it let's take a look
mp3/50ffb35ffcfff27e620000f3.mp3,she sounds like a chipmunk in this video why is her voice so high and squeaky
mp3/50ffb35ffcfff27e620000f4.mp3,i don't really dig this one too much but it even has over one hundred million views all by itself
mp3/50ffb35ffcfff27e620000f5.mp3,it looks like psy has been on practically every major us talk show the publicity he is getting for this song
mp3/50ffb35ffcfff27e620000f6.mp3,i guess it really caught on
mp3/50ffb5f6fcfff2a9ff0000a0.mp3,merry christmas joel what are you eating
mp3/50ffb5f6fcfff2a9ff0000a1.mp3,a candy cane do you want some
mp3/50ffb5f6fcfff2a9ff0000a3.mp3,it's a red and white peppermint stick it's an american tradition to eat candy canes at christmas time
mp3/50ffb5f6fcfff2a9ff0000a4.mp3,oh yeah i had heard about that
mp3/50ffb72ffcfff2a9ff0000a5.mp3,in my family we use them as ornaments on our christmas tree and eat them when we're opening presents
mp3/50ffb72ffcfff2a9ff0000a7.mp3,yeah that's pure delicious sugar you're tasting i like to stir mine in hot chocolate
mp3/50ffb72ffcfff2a9ff0000a8.mp3,that's a great idea i'm going to find a mug
mp3/50ffb62afcfff29c270000de.mp3,joel do you like to cook
mp3/50ffb62afcfff29c270000df.mp3,i actually love it my mom taught me how to bake and my dad taught me how to grill
mp3/50ffb62afcfff29c270000e0.mp3,that's really sweet what do you like to cook
mp3/50ffb62afcfff29c270000e1.mp3,my favorite thing to make is chicken noodle soup
mp3/50ffb62afcfff29c270000e3.mp3,yeah just saute celery some chopped carrots add chicken broth chicken breast and a dash of salt and pepper
mp3/50ffb62afcfff29c270000e5.mp3,when it boils add noodles after ten minutes it's done
mp3/50ffb62afcfff29c270000e6.mp3,that sounds delicious i love soups yum french onion butternut squash and chili
mp3/50ffb62afcfff29c270000e7.mp3,but nothing beats tomato soup and grilled cheese right
mp3/50ffb62afcfff29c270000e8.mp3,you can say that again that's been my favorite since kindergarten
mp3/50ffbca0fcfff2cf3f000116.mp3,apparently this whole gangnam style craze is really big in china too
mp3/50ffbca0fcfff2cf3f000117.mp3,yeah it's amazing how quickly it's caught on
mp3/50ffbca0fcfff2cf3f000118.mp3,one that's this huge worldwide has to be a really big deal in a country as populous as china
mp3/50ffbca0fcfff2cf3f000119.mp3,apparently chinese people call gangnam style jiangnan style
mp3/50ffbca0fcfff2cf3f00011a.mp3,isn't jiangnan a geographical area in china
mp3/50ffbca0fcfff2cf3f00011c.mp3,why wouldn't they just call it gang nan style that's pretty close to gangnam
mp3/50ffbca0fcfff2cf3f00011d.mp3,if you speak cantonese you would have no problem saying gangnam
mp3/50ffbca0fcfff2cf3f00011e.mp3,since cantonese words can end in an m sound right
mp3/50ffbca0fcfff2cf3f00011f.mp3,right i don't get it either
mp3/50ffc395fcfff27e620000fe.mp3,did you get to the bottom of this yet
mp3/50ffc395fcfff27e620000ff.mp3,i just asked one of my chinese friends and she said that jiangnan means south of the river
mp3/50ffc395fcfff27e62000101.mp3,well that's actually what gangnam means in korean
mp3/50ffc395fcfff27e62000102.mp3,oh so it's not a phonetic borrowing it's just an actual translation i get it
mp3/50ffc395fcfff27e62000103.mp3,yeah i guess that makes sense how would they have even found that out though
mp3/50ffc395fcfff27e62000105.mp3,right i don't think the meaning would be obvious
mp3/50ffc395fcfff27e62000106.mp3,maybe there was one chinese person who knew korean and told everyone else what it meant
mp3/50ffc395fcfff27e62000107.mp3,and then maybe as the video was getting popular it just stuck i dunno
mp3/50ffc6a4fcfff2cf3f000159.mp3,hey are you seriously going to the gym in those clothes
mp3/50ffc6a4fcfff2cf3f00015a.mp3,what's wrong with wearing a sweater and a pair of jeans everyone is wearing them
mp3/50ffc6a4fcfff2cf3f00015b.mp3,yeah to the mall and when they go out not when they go to the gym
mp3/50ffc6a4fcfff2cf3f00015c.mp3,i don't understand i need to look good when i go to the gym
mp3/50ffc6a4fcfff2cf3f00015d.mp3,you know that you're supposed to be exercising right you're not going to look very attractive when you're covered in sweat
mp3/50ffc6a4fcfff2cf3f00015e.mp3,so what should i wear then
mp3/50ffc6a4fcfff2cf3f00015f.mp3,what did you wear in grade nine gym class
mp3/50ffc6a4fcfff2cf3f000163.mp3,then you better go to the mall and find some clothes
mp3/50ffc6a4fcfff2cf3f000164.mp3,okay i'll get some more jeans and sweaters too
mp3/50ffc977fcfff29c27000106.mp3,i'm starting my new job tomorrow
mp3/50ffc977fcfff29c27000107.mp3,oh yeah your coaching job right are you excited
mp3/50ffc977fcfff29c27000108.mp3,yeah i am i have a bunch of activities planned out for them
mp3/50ffc977fcfff29c2700010a.mp3,well since i'm working as a badminton coach i figured i'd start with some coordinated footwork drills
mp3/50ffc977fcfff29c2700010b.mp3,good idea when i first started training i wasn't even allowed to hit a birdie for the first year
mp3/50ffc977fcfff29c2700010c.mp3,yeah it's important to learn how to move your feet before you learn how to hit the birdie
mp3/50ffc977fcfff29c2700010d.mp3,what else do you have planned
mp3/50ffc977fcfff29c2700010e.mp3,i was thinking some relay races kids always like to run around they have so much energy
mp3/50ffc977fcfff29c2700010f.mp3,how many kids are you coaching
mp3/50ffc977fcfff29c27000111.mp3,perfect you can split them up into three groups of four
mp3/50ffcb8dfcfff2cf3f000169.mp3,this dinner was delicious gabby thanks for having me over
mp3/50ffcb8dfcfff2cf3f00016b.mp3,what did you add to these mashed potatoes
mp3/50ffcb8dfcfff2cf3f00016c.mp3,you aren't asking me for my super secret family recipe are you
mp3/50ffcb8dfcfff2cf3f00016e.mp3,well because i trust you i'll tell you at first you do everything normally boil the potatoes in salted water until they are soft
mp3/50ffcb8dfcfff2cf3f000170.mp3,drain them add milk salt pepper and mash them until they're soft
mp3/50ffcb8dfcfff2cf3f000172.mp3,then i add a little butter a lot of crushed garlic and a packet of ranch seasoning
mp3/50ffcb8dfcfff2cf3f000174.mp3,sometimes i'll add a dash of chili pepper but you want to know the real secret ingredient
mp3/50ffcb8dfcfff2cf3f000176.mp3,love you can't have good mashed potatoes without stirring in a lot of love
mp3/50ffcc4ffcfff27e6200010a.mp3,yeah i do do you need to learn how to
mp3/50ffcc4ffcfff27e6200010d.mp3,what do you mean by that
mp3/50ffcc4ffcfff27e6200010f.mp3,so what you are telling me to do is to do some singles and then try to do a double every few skips
mp3/50ffcc4ffcfff27e62000110.mp3,exactly you will learn in no time
mp3/50ffcf56fcfff2cf3f000178.mp3,this whole gangnam style thing really surprises me like it really baffles me
mp3/50ffcf56fcfff2cf3f000179.mp3,how so can your feeble pea brain not comprehend the scope of its popularity
mp3/50ffcf56fcfff2cf3f00017a.mp3,i can comprehend it fine woman
mp3/50ffcf56fcfff2cf3f00017b.mp3,or maybe psy's individuality and style have you madly jealous
mp3/50ffcf56fcfff2cf3f00017c.mp3,first off i hate you second your style is horrible so you have no room to talk
mp3/50ffcf56fcfff2cf3f00017e.mp3,third it's just that i never imagined that a korean pop song would become this popular in the u s
mp3/50ffcf56fcfff2cf3f00017f.mp3,well everyone in the world likes it what do you expect
mp3/50ffcf56fcfff2cf3f000180.mp3,everyone in the world likes soccer too but america doesn't give two cares about it
mp3/50ffcf56fcfff2cf3f000181.mp3,okay so americans are just individualistic freedom the american way right
mp3/50ffcf56fcfff2cf3f000182.mp3,well yeah i guess if you consider cultural ignorance and racism individualistic
mp3/50ffcf56fcfff2cf3f000183.mp3,fair enough i accept your argument america is one of the most individualistic nations on earth
mp3/50ffcf56fcfff2cf3f000184.mp3,anyway my point is i would have been embarrassed to like k pop before now everyone likes it
mp3/50ffcf56fcfff2cf3f000185.mp3,people wouldn't try to beat you up for liking korean pop music they would beat you up because you're a nerd
mp3/50ffd05cfcfff2cf3f000188.mp3,hey let's go to the gym tomorrow i haven't done bench press in a long time
mp3/50ffd05cfcfff2cf3f000189.mp3,yeah sure what's the most you can lift
mp3/50ffd05cfcfff2cf3f00018a.mp3,i can bench about one eighty but i can only do one repetition
mp3/50ffd05cfcfff2cf3f00018b.mp3,that's not bad the most i've lifted is one ninety five
mp3/50ffd05cfcfff2cf3f00018c.mp3,i usually can't even lift my arms right after i've worked out
mp3/50ffd05cfcfff2cf3f00018d.mp3,i know what you mean by that i usually can't even scratch my head after i work out
mp3/50ffd05cfcfff2cf3f00018e.mp3,i know what you mean it's so frustrating
mp3/50ffd05cfcfff2cf3f00018f.mp3,i guess i just need to stretch more after i exercise
mp3/50ffd05cfcfff2cf3f000191.mp3,can't forget about that chocolate milk
mp3/50ffd370fcfff27e62000119.mp3,hey erik would you like to go to a hot yoga class with me
mp3/50ffd370fcfff27e6200011b.mp3,it's basically yoga but you're doing the exercises in a sauna so you'll be sweating a ton as well
mp3/50ffd370fcfff27e6200011c.mp3,that sounds really hard i've tried yoga before and it wasn't easy
mp3/50ffd370fcfff27e6200011d.mp3,no it's really good after the whole thing your body feels great 'cause you've sweat everything out
mp3/50ffd370fcfff27e6200011e.mp3,do you really want to see me sweating everywhere in this yoga class
mp3/50ffd370fcfff27e6200011f.mp3,that's gross and it won't be that bad everyone sweats in that class so it isn't just you
mp3/50ffd370fcfff27e62000120.mp3,can i at least bring water in
mp3/50ffd370fcfff27e62000121.mp3,of course you can bring water in you'd probably pass out if you couldn't bring water in
mp3/50ffd5adfcfff2a9ff0000ac.mp3,i just can't seem to hit my free throws consistently
mp3/50ffd5adfcfff2a9ff0000ad.mp3,you should try to use your legs more
mp3/50ffd5adfcfff2a9ff0000ae.mp3,what do you mean by that
mp3/50ffd5adfcfff2a9ff0000af.mp3,well whenever i see you shoot free throws you never bend your legs
mp3/50ffd5adfcfff2a9ff0000b1.mp3,yeah it really is your legs give you lift and that way you can always shoot consistently
mp3/50ffd5adfcfff2a9ff0000b2.mp3,so bend my knees and shoot with my legs not my arms sounds like it could work
mp3/50ffd5adfcfff2a9ff0000b3.mp3,yeah and you need a lot of practice too don't forget you need to practice to be good at something
mp3/50ffd5adfcfff2a9ff0000b4.mp3,okay i'll try to do all of that when i hit the court next
mp3/50ffd623fcfff2cf3f00019a.mp3,really though i feel like gangnam style is only remarkable as a cultural phenomenon
mp3/50ffd623fcfff2cf3f00019b.mp3,i don't really follow you here explain a little
mp3/50ffd623fcfff2cf3f00019c.mp3,okay well i would never have expected the american public to like a korean song this much
mp3/50ffd623fcfff2cf3f00019e.mp3,well it marks the start of social change in the u s
mp3/50ffd623fcfff2cf3f00019f.mp3,don't you think you're being a little dramatic
mp3/50ffd623fcfff2cf3f0001a0.mp3,not at all americans usually only listen to music from america or england
mp3/50ffd623fcfff2cf3f0001a1.mp3,i listen to music from other countries sometimes but it usually has to be in english
mp3/50ffd623fcfff2cf3f0001a2.mp3,exactly but gangnam style only has one line that's in english hey sexy lady
mp3/50ffd623fcfff2cf3f0001a3.mp3,so they just like the sound of it
mp3/50ffd623fcfff2cf3f0001a4.mp3,exactly the american public have moved beyond caring about music and can focus on energy alone
mp3/50ffd623fcfff2cf3f0001a5.mp3,wait uhh is that actually a positive thing
mp3/50ffd623fcfff2cf3f0001a6.mp3,it just shows that taste in music got so bad that lyrics ceased to matter to anyone
mp3/50ffd623fcfff2cf3f0001a7.mp3,that just sounds like the dumbing down of a society
mp3/50ffd641fcfff2a9ff0000b6.mp3,jen um what are you doing
mp3/50ffd641fcfff2a9ff0000b8.mp3,i can see that what do you have in this basket potato salad with mayonnaise cold chicken wings potato chips
mp3/50ffd641fcfff2a9ff0000ba.mp3,you even have a picnic blanket jen why are you going on a picnic
mp3/50ffd641fcfff2a9ff0000bb.mp3,because my favorite holiday is the fourth of july and i wanted to celebrate it in china
mp3/50ffd641fcfff2a9ff0000bc.mp3,jen it's january and it's really cold outside
mp3/50ffd641fcfff2a9ff0000bd.mp3,i know but these are my favorite foods and i miss them i just decided to celebrate early do you want to join me
mp3/50ffd641fcfff2a9ff0000be.mp3,heck yeah what can i do
mp3/50ffd641fcfff2a9ff0000bf.mp3,help me lay out the picnic blanket in the living room then get the candles
mp3/50ffd641fcfff2a9ff0000c1.mp3,the candles will help light the sparklers later
mp3/50ffd641fcfff2a9ff0000c2.mp3,girl you're crazy but i love this idea
mp3/50ffd641fcfff2a9ff0000c3.mp3,thanks joel happy fourth of july in january
mp3/50ffd882fcfff2cf3f0001aa.mp3,hey so in the olympics a triathlon is a event where the athlete runs swims and bikes right
mp3/50ffd882fcfff2cf3f0001ac.mp3,so a biathlon is an event with only two sports right
mp3/50ffd882fcfff2cf3f0001ae.mp3,so is it running and biking swimming and biking or running and swimming
mp3/50ffd882fcfff2cf3f0001af.mp3,actually it's none of those a biathlon is skiing and rifle shooting
mp3/50ffd882fcfff2cf3f0001b0.mp3,really it's a winter event i never knew that
mp3/50ffd882fcfff2cf3f0001b2.mp3,that's pretty cool i've never seen it on the olympics before
mp3/50ffd882fcfff2cf3f0001b3.mp3,well it isn't the most exciting event so that makes sense
mp3/50ffd882fcfff2cf3f0001b4.mp3,alright thanks for clearing that up for me
mp3/50ffdb85fcfff29c27000137.mp3,so we're going to actually do this i'm going to hot yoga
mp3/50ffdb85fcfff29c27000138.mp3,i promise you you'll like it as long as you dress appropriately
mp3/50ffdb85fcfff29c2700013a.mp3,okay good you'll be fine in that you also brought a change of clothes too right
mp3/50ffdb85fcfff29c2700013b.mp3,change of clothes no i only brought what i was wearing
mp3/50ffdb85fcfff29c2700013c.mp3,oh no you're going to freeze after the class it's so cold outside
mp3/50ffdb85fcfff29c2700013d.mp3,i guess i never thought of that can i go home and get a change of clothes
mp3/50ffdb85fcfff29c2700013e.mp3,if you do we're going to be way too late the yoga teacher doesn't like it when you're late
mp3/50ffdb85fcfff29c2700013f.mp3,it's okay i'll tough it out
mp3/50ffdb85fcfff29c27000140.mp3,alright i guess you should just dress warmly after the class and dry yourself off before going outside
mp3/50fffe40fcfff29c270001c4.mp3,gabby what's wrong why are you so sad
mp3/50fffe40fcfff29c270001c5.mp3,i really miss my mom it's her birthday today
mp3/50fffe40fcfff29c270001c6.mp3,oh what do you usually do for her birthday i mean how did you celebrate
mp3/50fffe40fcfff29c270001c7.mp3,every morning on her birthday we'd make oatmeal raisin cookies because she loved them so much
mp3/50fffe40fcfff29c270001c8.mp3,we can make them now how about it
mp3/50fffe40fcfff29c270001cb.mp3,oatmeal brown and white sugar eggs vanilla flour um baking soda cinnamon and raisins
mp3/50fffe40fcfff29c270001cc.mp3,wow that was impressive ok let's get started
mp3/50fffe40fcfff29c270001cd.mp3,so first we need a big bowl so we can mix together the butter and sugars until creamy
mp3/50fffe40fcfff29c270001cf.mp3,then we need to beat in the eggs and vanilla
mp3/50fffe40fcfff29c270001d1.mp3,next we need to add the baking soda cinnamon and salt oats and raisins
mp3/50fffe40fcfff29c270001d2.mp3,then we need to stir them together
mp3/50fffe40fcfff29c270001d3.mp3,yes and finally drop spoonfuls of dough onto a cookie sheet voila oatmeal raisin cookies

mp3/5100edaafcfff29c27000315.mp3,just coat the bottom of a pan with oil add a layer of kernels and salt cover it with a lid and keep shaking it over the burner
mp3/5100edaafcfff29c27000316.mp3,you make it look so easy though i get scared of burning it
mp3/5100edaafcfff29c27000317.mp3,if you can count for three seconds in between pops it's done you have to listen carefully though

mp3/51011f8cfcfff2a9ff0001a9.mp3,you can peel four apples core and slice them and place them in this pie dish i'll make the topping
mp3/51011f8cfcfff2a9ff0001ab.mp3,a stick of butter oatmeal brown sugar walnuts if i have them baking soda and a little salt
mp3/51011f8cfcfff2a9ff0001ac.mp3,that sounds delicious should you heat the butter
mp3/51011f8cfcfff2a9ff0001ad.mp3,yes once the butter is melted it helps everything stick together it's an easy crumbly topping
mp3/51011f8cfcfff2a9ff0001af.mp3,yep then we put it in the oven for about forty minutes or until the apples are soft
mp3/51011f8cfcfff2a9ff0001b0.mp3,cool i can't wait to taste it

mp3/5106583bfcfff29c27000952.mp3,rebecca we've been exercising together a lot so can i ask you a question
mp3/5106583bfcfff29c27000954.mp3,are you one of those girls who count calories
mp3/5106583bfcfff29c27000955.mp3,not really i try to eat healthily i basically try to follow the food pyramid and avoid a lot of sugars
mp3/5106583bfcfff29c27000956.mp3,can you give me an example
mp3/5106583bfcfff29c27000957.mp3,umm sure for example this morning i ate a banana scrambled eggs whole grain toast and a glass of orange juice
mp3/5106583bfcfff29c27000958.mp3,and the rest of your day
mp3/5106583bfcfff29c27000959.mp3,i try to snack on apples and nuts throughout the day and usually have roasted chicken and a lettuce salad for dinner
mp3/5106583bfcfff29c2700095c.mp3,well my sister is trying a new crash diet and i'm a little worried about her
mp3/5106583bfcfff29c2700095d.mp3,crash diets are never good for your body
mp3/5106583bfcfff29c2700095e.mp3,yeah she seems obsessed with counting calories her last meal was just a cup of tea and a handful of carrots
mp3/51065c8efcfff2cf3f000906.mp3,if your sister is trying a new diet it's important to know why does she have an unhealthy self image
mp3/51065c8efcfff2cf3f000907.mp3,i don't know when she was younger she was a little chubby i used to tease her about her baby fat
mp3/51065c8efcfff2cf3f000909.mp3,yeah i wasn't always the most supportive big brother but she's sixteen now and doesn't have a lot of weight to lose
mp3/51065c8efcfff2cf3f00090a.mp3,why don't you encourage her to try some healthier ways like cooking some meals with lots of veggies and exercising together
mp3/51065c8efcfff2cf3f00090b.mp3,yeah i can try that i want her to know that she's beautiful the way she is
mp3/51065c8efcfff2cf3f00090d.mp3,you're right i should tell her i hope she listens i just want her to be healthy and not anorexic or obsessed with every pound
mp3/51065c8efcfff2cf3f00090e.mp3,as her big brother you can really help her know she doesn't need to be a super model to be attractive
mp3/510a21c7fcfff2fc6d000457.mp3,what it's so loud in here
mp3/510a21c7fcfff2fc6d000459.mp3,she'll take a gin and tonic

mp3/510a77f7fcfff271000005b9.mp3,yeah seems like the houston rockets overpaid for his contract this season
mp3/510a77f7fcfff271000005ba.mp3,i really don't like how he works with james harden they are just too similar in their playing style
mp3/510a77f7fcfff271000005bb.mp3,definitely i think lin also has a lot of pressure to perform extremely well this year too
mp3/510a77f7fcfff271000005bc.mp3,yeah after his breakout performance last season the expectations for him have been really high
mp3/510a77f7fcfff271000005bd.mp3,well he has put together a decent string of games especially when he went back to new york
mp3/510a77f7fcfff271000005be.mp3,true let's not forget that he didn't get to have a training camp with james harden either
mp3/510a77f7fcfff271000005bf.mp3,oh yeah that trade happened at the beginning of the season i totally forgot about that
mp3/510a77f7fcfff271000005c0.mp3,i hope he starts to perform consistently though i really like him
mp3/510a78adfcfff2fc6d000485.mp3,hey did you watch the basketball game yesterday
mp3/510a78adfcfff2fc6d000486.mp3,which one there were so many on last night

mp3/510a78adfcfff2fc6d000488.mp3,battle of the boroughs why is it called that
mp3/510a78adfcfff2fc6d000489.mp3,because the new jersey nets are now called the brooklyn nets
mp3/510a78adfcfff2fc6d00048a.mp3,wow was it a good game
mp3/510a78adfcfff2fc6d00048c.mp3,didn't that get rescheduled because of hurricane sandy
mp3/510a78adfcfff2fc6d00048d.mp3,it did i was supposed to go to it do you want to watch the next game
mp3/510a78adfcfff2fc6d00048e.mp3,definitely do you want to go to a sports bar and watch it over a pitcher of beer and some wings
mp3/510a78adfcfff2fc6d00048f.mp3,yeah that sounds like a great idea
mp3/510a794efcfff2aea2000604.mp3,who is the best player in the league right now lebron james or kevin durant
mp3/510a794efcfff2aea2000605.mp3,it's got to be lebron james hands down no questions asked
mp3/510a794efcfff2aea2000606.mp3,nah i think kevin durant is better he's a more efficient scorer
mp3/510a794efcfff2aea2000608.mp3,kevin durant is a three time scoring champ three time all star and he's only twenty four
mp3/510a794efcfff2aea200060a.mp3,the thunder will win soon don't worry about that their youth and potential can't be ignored
mp3/510a794efcfff2aea200060b.mp3,miami heat are going to win again this season

mp3/510a7a21fcfff2aea2000613.mp3,i lost all hope once christmas passed i seriously thought it was going to be over this season
mp3/510a7a21fcfff2aea2000614.mp3,i'm glad they were finally able to come to an agreement
mp3/510a7a21fcfff2aea2000615.mp3,we were running out of things to watch that's for sure

mp3/510a7c27fcfff2aea2000619.mp3,hey jeff i'm going to come pick you up soon for the volleyball game
mp3/510a7c27fcfff2aea200061a.mp3,alright cool i'll put my stuff together
mp3/510a7c27fcfff2aea200061b.mp3,make sure you bring your volleyball so the team can practice a bit too
mp3/510a7c27fcfff2aea200061c.mp3,are you picking anyone else up
mp3/510a7c27fcfff2aea200061d.mp3,yeah cathy and kitty are already in my car
mp3/510a7c27fcfff2aea200061e.mp3,ok should we go out to eat afterwards
mp3/510a7c27fcfff2aea200061f.mp3,yeah i'd like to go eat but let's run it by everyone else first
mp3/510a7c27fcfff2aea2000620.mp3,i think it would be a good idea to go for a team dinner after our first game
mp3/510a7c27fcfff2aea2000621.mp3,i think it's a good idea but it's wednesday night tomorrow's a work day
mp3/510a7c27fcfff2aea2000623.mp3,oh by the way cathy forgot her water can you bring an extra bottle
mp3/510a7ccdfcfff2aea2000626.mp3,how come the los angeles lakers are doing so poorly
mp3/510a7ccdfcfff2aea2000628.mp3,i really thought their team would be so much better with so many different stars
mp3/510a7ccdfcfff2aea2000629.mp3,i thought that steve nash and kobe bryant working together would be the main issue
mp3/510a7ccdfcfff2aea200062a.mp3,i thought the same thing too seems like dwight howard is the odd one out
mp3/510a7ccdfcfff2aea200062b.mp3,at this rate they may not even make it into the playoffs
mp3/510a7ccdfcfff2aea200062d.mp3,it's probably the most disappointing team in the league
mp3/510a7ccdfcfff2aea200062e.mp3,who knows they might pick it up by the time playoffs roll around
mp3/510a7d85fcfff2aea2000631.mp3,so we just played the first game what did you think of it
mp3/510a7d85fcfff2aea2000632.mp3,well we won but we could have played better defense
mp3/510a7d85fcfff2aea2000634.mp3,we just have to practice our setting game we just need to get some better shots
mp3/510a7d85fcfff2aea2000635.mp3,yeah anyways where are we going to eat tonight
mp3/510a7d85fcfff2aea2000636.mp3,let's go for hamburgers at shake shack
mp3/510a7d85fcfff2aea2000637.mp3,we can put on all that weight we lost from volleyball
mp3/510a7d85fcfff2aea2000638.mp3,hey we won right let's splurge for a day
mp3/510a7d85fcfff2aea2000639.mp3,i've been eating way too much fast food but whatever let's go pig out
mp3/510a7e34fcfff2b1ca0005ac.mp3,who do you think is the best point guard chris paul or kyrie irving
mp3/510a7e34fcfff2b1ca0005ad.mp3,i think irving is a great point guard he's so young and so good chris paul is better right now though
mp3/510a7e34fcfff2b1ca0005ae.mp3,i think if irving plays another two or three years he'll be just as good as chris paul
mp3/510a7e34fcfff2b1ca0005af.mp3,chris paul is just so interesting to watch he just takes over the game sometimes
mp3/510a7e34fcfff2b1ca0005b0.mp3,yeah but kyrie irving is called mr fourth quarter he almost never misses in tight games
mp3/510a7e34fcfff2b1ca0005b1.mp3,the cavaliers have to bring some help in for irving though it's too bad they suck so much
mp3/510a7e34fcfff2b1ca0005b2.mp3,can you imagine how crazy that team would be if irving was playing with another good player
mp3/510a7e34fcfff2b1ca0005b3.mp3,it's only a matter of time until he gets better
mp3/510a7e34fcfff2b1ca0005b4.mp3,i can't wait for the clippers and cavaliers square off again
mp3/510a8731fcfff2aea2000640.mp3,did you catch a cold or something
mp3/510a8731fcfff2aea2000641.mp3,no there was a party at nate's house last night ugh that light's so bright isn't there a dimmer around here
mp3/510a8731fcfff2aea2000642.mp3,ah classic hangover does your stomach hurt too
mp3/510a8731fcfff2aea2000643.mp3,yeah and my mouth is really dry
mp3/510a8731fcfff2aea2000644.mp3,here drink some orange juice it'll make you feel a little better
mp3/510a8731fcfff2aea2000646.mp3,yep and if that doesn't work you can always drink the hair of the dog that bit you or try a bloody mary
mp3/510a8731fcfff2aea2000647.mp3,ugh i'll take the bloody mary
mp3/510a8731fcfff2aea2000648.mp3,good choice at least there are vitamins in the tomato juice and celery
mp3/510b36c4fcfff2aea200069c.mp3,where to i'm tired of my usual hang outs
mp3/510b36c4fcfff2aea200069d.mp3,i'm going to a new place it's called the library do you know it you're welcome to come
mp3/510b36c4fcfff2aea200069e.mp3,seriously so i could tell my dad i'm going to the library tonight what kind of music do they have
mp3/510b36c4fcfff2aea200069f.mp3,my friend is the d j he said if i come i could request whatever i wanted from the playlist

mp3/510b4267fcfff2aea20006a5.mp3,hey tony i heard you're coordinating the employee outing next week
mp3/510b4267fcfff2aea20006a6.mp3,yeah i'm on the party committee this year did you get all the details about the event
mp3/510b4267fcfff2aea20006a7.mp3,on saturday meet in the company's underground parking at four and caravan to the stadium right
mp3/510b4267fcfff2aea20006a8.mp3,you got it we'll tail gate in the stadium parking lot until the game any other questions
mp3/510b4267fcfff2aea20006aa.mp3,the company will provide hot dogs buns chips and soda bring whatever you want to throw on the grill
mp3/510b4267fcfff2aea20006ac.mp3,b y o b oh and we'll have lawn chairs but if you have your own bring it just in case
mp3/510b4267fcfff2aea20006ad.mp3,cool can i bring my boyfriend
mp3/510b4267fcfff2aea20006ae.mp3,yeah every employee can bring one guest just let me know by tomorrow if he's coming
mp3/510b6ba7fcfff271000005f5.mp3,ah the weekend has arrived can you guess what i'm going to do all weekend
mp3/510b6ba7fcfff271000005f8.mp3,are you going to go anywhere to enjoy your time off
mp3/510b6ba7fcfff271000005fa.mp3,are you going to be a sad example of a human being
mp3/510b6ba7fcfff271000005fc.mp3,so you're going to sit on this couch all weekend
mp3/510b6ba7fcfff271000005fd.mp3,as much as is humanly possible
mp3/510b6ba7fcfff271000005fe.mp3,i am so embarrassed to know you
mp3/510b6f45fcfff2b1ca000602.mp3,why don't you pull up a chair and give this lifestyle a try
mp3/510b6f45fcfff2b1ca000603.mp3,if i wanted to commit to being unproductive i'd just go be homeless
mp3/510b6f45fcfff2b1ca000604.mp3,homeless people get more done than i do now sit down
mp3/510b6f45fcfff2b1ca000605.mp3,okay so what do you do all day while you do this
mp3/510b6f45fcfff2b1ca000606.mp3,i pretty much just watch whatever is on tv
mp3/510b6f45fcfff2b1ca000609.mp3,i can feel myself getting fatter
mp3/510b7dfbfcfff27100000602.mp3,do you follow the phoenix suns at all
mp3/510b7dfbfcfff27100000603.mp3,not since i was a kid when i watched basketball with my dad
mp3/510b7dfbfcfff27100000604.mp3,i'll fill you in then the suns made it to the semifinals a year or two ago it was really intense
mp3/510b7dfbfcfff27100000606.mp3,no ultimately they lost to the l a lakers
mp3/510b7dfbfcfff27100000607.mp3,wow i never knew they had done that well
mp3/510b7dfbfcfff27100000608.mp3,there were a lot of factors but a big part of their success could be contributed to steve nash
mp3/510b7dfbfcfff27100000609.mp3,wow he was so good that they almost won
mp3/510b7dfbfcfff2710000060a.mp3,yeah he was great then he got traded to the lakers
mp3/510b8c66fcfff2aea20006b1.mp3,after steve nash got traded to the lakers i kinda lost interest in the suns
mp3/510b8c66fcfff2aea20006b3.mp3,not necessarily the suns are still a good franchise
mp3/510b8c66fcfff2aea20006b5.mp3,yeah sports teams are teams of athletes on the surface level but in reality they're bought and sold
mp3/510b8c66fcfff2aea20006b6.mp3,so sports teams are effectively brands
mp3/510b8c66fcfff2aea20006b7.mp3,more or less sometimes whole sports teams are sold to different cities
mp3/510b8c66fcfff2aea20006b9.mp3,short answer no but it's a tradeoff for us viewers
mp3/510b8c66fcfff2aea20006bb.mp3,we wouldn't get this kind of high quality entertainment if rich people weren't investing a lot of money into it
mp3/510b8c66fcfff2aea20006bc.mp3,i guess money does make the world go around
mp3/510d2e96fcfff2b1ca00063a.mp3,hey emily how's the job hunt going
mp3/510d2e96fcfff2b1ca00063b.mp3,pretty good i have two interviews next week
mp3/510d2e96fcfff2b1ca00063c.mp3,oh really that's great who are they with
mp3/510d2e96fcfff2b1ca00063d.mp3,i have one with accenture and one with deloitte what about you
mp3/510d2e96fcfff2b1ca00063e.mp3,nice well i'm trying hard to get an interview at an investment bank
mp3/510d2e96fcfff2b1ca00063f.mp3,well good luck the market is very competitive these days it's hard to get a job
mp3/510d2e96fcfff2b1ca000640.mp3,yes it is you know we should practice together maybe this weekend we can go over some interview questions
mp3/510d2e96fcfff2b1ca000641.mp3,ok sounds good let me check my schedule and get back to you
mp3/510d2ff9fcfff2fc6d00052a.mp3,alex i'm free sunday afternoon does that work
mp3/510d2ff9fcfff2fc6d00052b.mp3,sure let's meet at the starbucks on the corner of beacon and fairfield at three pm
mp3/510d2ff9fcfff2fc6d00052c.mp3,perfect so have you heard from any of the banks yet
mp3/510d2ff9fcfff2fc6d00052d.mp3,yes i did i have an interview next week with j p morgan i'm really excited
mp3/510d2ff9fcfff2fc6d00052e.mp3,that's great my first interview is next week too i'm getting a little nervous
mp3/510d2ff9fcfff2fc6d00052f.mp3,don't worry we'll practice hard this weekend and build up some confidence
mp3/510d2ff9fcfff2fc6d000530.mp3,i hope so i've read online that i'll have to talk through a case
mp3/510d2ff9fcfff2fc6d000531.mp3,yes they'll ask you about a business scenario such as how an airline company should go about adding new routes
mp3/510d2ff9fcfff2fc6d000532.mp3,wow that does sound hard i have some studying to do
mp3/510d2ff9fcfff2fc6d000533.mp3,it's okay we'll talk about it on sunday you'll ace that case
mp3/510d30ccfcfff2aea20006dc.mp3,hey emily how's your weekend going
mp3/510d30ccfcfff2aea20006dd.mp3,not great i've been studying for my interviews all weekend
mp3/510d30ccfcfff2aea20006df.mp3,ok the interviews usually begin with a walk me through your resume type question
mp3/510d30ccfcfff2aea20006e0.mp3,yes but what does that mean
mp3/510d30ccfcfff2aea20006e1.mp3,they'll ask you to describe your work experience and explain why you've chosen your particular jobs
mp3/510d30ccfcfff2aea20006e2.mp3,can i just say that i chose the first company that would hire me
mp3/510d30ccfcfff2aea20006e3.mp3,ha ha probably not employers like to see people with clear goals and a track record of increasing responsibility
mp3/510d30ccfcfff2aea20006e5.mp3,a track record is a way to say a history of
mp3/510d30ccfcfff2aea20006e6.mp3,oh so for example i can say i have a track record of bombing interviews
mp3/510d30ccfcfff2aea20006e7.mp3,no no you haven't failed any interviews interviewing is a skill that always improves with practice
mp3/510d3241fcfff2710000062c.mp3,hey alex i think my second interview went well
mp3/510d3241fcfff2710000062e.mp3,yes i felt more comfortable walking through my resume
mp3/510d3241fcfff2710000062f.mp3,like i said before practice makes perfect when will you hear back
mp3/510d3241fcfff27100000630.mp3,within a week if i pass this first round i'll take a trip to their office in new york city for a full day of interviews
mp3/510d3241fcfff27100000631.mp3,wow what company was this again
mp3/510d3241fcfff27100000632.mp3,deloitte i'm applying for the associate consultant position in their management and strategy group
mp3/510d32dcfcfff27100000635.mp3,alex i have some great news i passed the first round i was invited to final round interviews in new york city
mp3/510d32dcfcfff27100000637.mp3,the interviews take place in two weeks but tell me about you how are your interviews going
mp3/510d32dcfcfff27100000638.mp3,i just had my first interview yesterday i think it went well but i need to study financial statements a bit more
mp3/510d32dcfcfff27100000639.mp3,do you mean the balance sheet
mp3/510d32dcfcfff2710000063a.mp3,yes banks really like to see candidates with a proficient understanding of the four statements
mp3/510d32dcfcfff2710000063b.mp3,i can hardly remember what the four statements are
mp3/510d32dcfcfff2710000063c.mp3,well you might want to dig out that old accounting book and brush up a bit
mp3/510d32dcfcfff2710000063d.mp3,looks like i have more things to study this weekend thanks alex
mp3/510d3380fcfff2aea20006ea.mp3,how did the final round interview go
mp3/510d3380fcfff2aea20006eb.mp3,actually it was postponed for a couple weeks i guess they want to interview a few more candidates first
mp3/510d3380fcfff2aea20006ec.mp3,now you have more time to practice
mp3/510d3380fcfff2aea20006ed.mp3,i suppose but now i'm just anxious i really want the whole process to be over
mp3/510d3380fcfff2aea20006ee.mp3,i understand recruiting is pretty stressful
mp3/510d3380fcfff2aea20006f0.mp3,they're going i have two more next week so far i haven't secured a final round interview yet but i remain hopeful
mp3/510d3380fcfff2aea20006f1.mp3,i have confidence in you don't worry

mp3/510e6d45fcfff2aea2000731.mp3,a lot of stuff i have satellite t v the ultimate way to abandon dreams of productivity
mp3/510e6d45fcfff2aea2000732.mp3,what else is on that is worth watching
mp3/510e6d45fcfff2aea2000733.mp3,have you seen the walking dead
mp3/510e6d45fcfff2aea2000735.mp3,zombies some kind of zombie outbreak occurs and the story focuses on a police officer from georgia
mp3/510e6d45fcfff2aea2000736.mp3,that sounds pretty good is it on right now
mp3/510e6d45fcfff2aea2000737.mp3,not right this second i think a new episode comes out this week though
mp3/510e6d45fcfff2aea2000738.mp3,is it a really popular show
mp3/510e6d45fcfff2aea2000739.mp3,yeah it's extremely popular it only made the american obsession with zombies even stronger
mp3/510e7fbffcfff2710000066a.mp3,are there any other shows i need to know about
mp3/510e7fbffcfff2710000066b.mp3,well given that it seems like you used to live under a rock did you ever watch lost
mp3/510e7fbffcfff2710000066c.mp3,no but i think i heard about it worth watching
mp3/510e7fbffcfff2710000066d.mp3,initially yes it's really interesting in the beginning after a while it gets a little too far fetched though
mp3/510e7fbffcfff2710000066e.mp3,so it was a pretty long series then
mp3/510e7fbffcfff2710000066f.mp3,yeah i heard that the writers wrote the show week to week so that explains why it was so goofy at times
mp3/510e7fbffcfff27100000671.mp3,eh the ending kinda sucked once it finally ended
mp3/510e7fbffcfff27100000673.mp3,suit yourself not like you've got anything better to do
mp3/510e7fbffcfff27100000674.mp3,speak for yourself i actually do try to accomplish things in this life
mp3/510f1ab8fcfff2aea200074c.mp3,have you heard of breaking bad i think even if i did want to be productive i'd take breaks to watch it
mp3/510f1ab8fcfff2aea200074d.mp3,nope what is that one about
mp3/510f1ab8fcfff2aea200074e.mp3,it's about a high school chemistry teacher who finds out he has lung cancer
mp3/510f1ab8fcfff2aea2000750.mp3,so he starts making and selling drugs using science so that he can leave money behind for his family
mp3/510f1ab8fcfff2aea2000751.mp3,wow that sounds kind of engaging
mp3/510f1ab8fcfff2aea2000752.mp3,it really is it's so intense that i get a stomach ache whenever i watch it the plot is so complex and rich
mp3/510f1ab8fcfff2aea2000754.mp3,oh yeah the writer of the show isn't afraid to let the characters get hurt
mp3/510f1ab8fcfff2aea2000755.mp3,does it ever get too violent a lot of media relies on being excessive to get ratings
mp3/510f1ab8fcfff2aea2000756.mp3,i don't think so the only thing that's excessive is how real the characters in the show are
mp3/510f1ab8fcfff2aea2000757.mp3,how do you mean how is that excessive
mp3/510f1ab8fcfff2aea2000758.mp3,well we're all used to fake characters these people act like real people
mp3/510f1ab8fcfff2aea2000759.mp3,i should give it a try when i get a chance then
mp3/510f254ffcfff2aea200075b.mp3,oh man have you heard of this show it's called big bang theory
mp3/510f254ffcfff2aea200075d.mp3,kind of no it's about nerds
mp3/510f254ffcfff2aea200075f.mp3,since this show it's about a bunch of doctorates and one guy who only has a master's degree
mp3/510f254ffcfff2aea2000761.mp3,nah it's pretty funny every single chinese person i meet really likes this show they all say it's hilarious
mp3/510f254ffcfff2aea2000762.mp3,maybe chinese people like intellectualism more than they do violence unlike americans
mp3/510f254ffcfff2aea2000763.mp3,who knows they definitely like this show though oh sheldon you basket case
mp3/510f254ffcfff2aea2000764.mp3,a show about nerds what could possibly be redeeming about that
mp3/510f358bfcfff2aea2000767.mp3,what no who likes serial killers
mp3/510f358bfcfff2aea2000768.mp3,well i don't actually mean do you like serial killers i mean are they interesting
mp3/510f358bfcfff2aea200076a.mp3,there's this pretty popular show called dexter about a serial killer who works for the police
mp3/510f358bfcfff2aea200076c.mp3,he's a master killer he learned from his dad nobody knows he kills people
mp3/510f358bfcfff2aea200076d.mp3,how is he a likeable character then
mp3/510f358bfcfff2aea200076e.mp3,he only kills bad people who he knows are guilty but who the law can't prove guilty
mp3/510f3b82fcfff2fc6d0005cd.mp3,do i look like a child
mp3/510f3b82fcfff2fc6d0005ce.mp3,do i i'm a thirty year old neckbeard and i still watch cartoons
mp3/510f3b82fcfff2fc6d0005cf.mp3,right which has a lot to do with you being a neckbeard
mp3/510f3b82fcfff2fc6d0005d0.mp3,anyway have you heard of adventure time
mp3/510f3b82fcfff2fc6d0005d1.mp3,i've heard of it but i don't know anything about it
mp3/510f3b82fcfff2fc6d0005d2.mp3,it's about the last human on earth finn and his friend jake a magic dog
mp3/510f3b82fcfff2fc6d0005d3.mp3,why is this interesting to adults
mp3/510f3b82fcfff2fc6d0005d4.mp3,because it takes place on earth after earth was destroyed in a nuclear war
mp3/510f3b82fcfff2fc6d0005d5.mp3,wow that's a pretty dark setting for a kid's show
mp3/510f3b82fcfff2fc6d0005d6.mp3,really i don't think it's meant for kids in the first place it's much too clever to be
mp3/510f599ffcfff2fc6d000654.mp3,today is my day off work so i am going to do absolutely nothing
mp3/510f599ffcfff2fc6d000655.mp3,but it is a nice day don't you want to do something outside

mp3/5136a5cbfcfff22e1b04b827.mp3,tomorrow morning 8:00 am is the earliest flight the airline could arrange we apologize for the inconvenience
mp3/5136a6d3fcfff2e7b404ceb3.mp3,american airlines how may i help you
mp3/5136a6d3fcfff2e7b404ceb4.mp3,hi i'm calling to ask about flying with our dog
mp3/5136a6d3fcfff2e7b404ceb5.mp3,what type of dog is it
mp3/5136a6d3fcfff2e7b404ceb6.mp3,we have a cocker spaniel she's not very big
mp3/5136a6d3fcfff2e7b404ceb7.mp3,would the dog travel with you or in cargo the fee is \$100 for a cargo animal and \$150 for a cabin animal
mp3/5136a6d3fcfff2e7b404ceb8.mp3,we'd prefer our dog stayed in the cabin with us
mp3/5136a6d3fcfff2e7b404ceb9.mp3,the weight limit for animals in the cabin is 20 pounds including the animal and the carrier
mp3/5136a6d3fcfff2e7b404ceba.mp3,how big can the carrier be
mp3/5136a6d3fcfff2e7b404cebb.mp3,maximum size for pet carriers brought inside the cabin is 19 inches long by 13 inches wide by 9 inches high
mp3/5136a6d3fcfff2e7b404cebd.mp3,carriers should be large enough for pets to lie down stand up and turn around inside
mp3/5136a6d3fcfff2e7b404cebf.mp3,one more thing pet carriers should be labeled with your name and home address
mp3/5136af9efcfff2e7b404e4c6.mp3,i thought a thong and strapless bra would be best
mp3/5136af9efcfff2e7b404e4c8.mp3,of course i am i'll wear the most comfortable and supportive underwear i can
mp3/5136af9efcfff2e7b404e4c9.mp3,what about those nice black dress pants
mp3/5136af9efcfff2e7b404e4cb.mp3,yeah those look nice on you and are still comfortable and black doesn't show wrinkles
mp3/5136af9efcfff2e7b404e4cc.mp3,good idea i'm going to wear layers on top starting with a tank top and then adding a lightweight long-sleeved shirt on top
mp3/5136af9efcfff2e7b404e4cd.mp3,will you bring a cardigan or a jacket
mp3/5136af9efcfff2e7b404e4ce.mp3,i think a cardigan mike can you not wear a sweatshirt
mp3/5136af9efcfff2e7b404e4d0.mp3,yeah but it looks sloppy we haven't seen my parents for six months
mp3/5136af9efcfff2e7b404e4d1.mp3,okay i'll wear a sports jacket it'll still be comfortable but it won't look like i'm ready for a sleepover
mp3/5136b4e1fcfff22e1b04e3fe.mp3,an extra shirt and pants my baseball hat my laptop my camera sunglasses and toiletries

mp3/514bf361fcfff26bf1024543.mp3,a big boat what happened in it
mp3/514bf361fcfff26bf1024544.mp3,i don't really remember to be honest it takes place in a cold place and there is a lot of ice
mp3/514bf361fcfff26bf1024545.mp3,i hope you are not talking about the movie i think you're talking about
mp3/514bf361fcfff26bf1024546.mp3,i think the boat runs into a giant iceberg and sinks too does that sound familiar
mp3/514bf361fcfff26bf1024547.mp3,it's titanic you're talking about titanic one of the greatest movies of all time
mp3/514bf361fcfff26bf1024548.mp3,are you sure it is called titanic
mp3/514bf361fcfff26bf1024549.mp3,i am certain i cannot believe you forgot the name of such a classic movie
mp3/514bf361fcfff26bf102454a.mp3,wow you really know your movies
mp3/514bf8cffcfff21ed4025303.mp3,hey sam have you seen the lion king
mp3/514bf8cffcfff21ed4025304.mp3,of course i have it's a classic disney movie
mp3/514bf8cffcfff21ed4025305.mp3,i agree i think it's my favorite disney movie
mp3/514bf8cffcfff21ed4025306.mp3,why did you suddenly ask me that question
mp3/514bf8cffcfff21ed4025307.mp3,oh i saw it on tv the other day it brought back some old memories
mp3/514bf8cffcfff21ed4025309.mp3,i hate to admit it but i did it was so sad
mp3/514bf8cffcfff21ed402530a.mp3,i hate to admit it too but i cried too i was only seven years old when i watched it
mp3/514bf8cffcfff21ed402530c.mp3,i know stop making fun of me
mp3/514bfb54fcfff2b7e701081c.mp3,i just watched all of the high school musical movies
mp3/514bfb54fcfff2b7e701081d.mp3,i hate musicals why are they so popular now
mp3/514bfb54fcfff2b7e701081e.mp3,why don't you like musicals you don't like it when people sing
mp3/514bfb54fcfff2b7e701081f.mp3,if i wanted to see people sing i'd watch a music video or just listen to music
mp3/514bfb54fcfff2b7e7010820.mp3,but the dancing is so good and it's cool to see it synchronized with the singing
mp3/514bfb54fcfff2b7e7010821.mp3,it's just a fad trust me musicals will disappear soon enough
mp3/514bfb54fcfff2b7e7010822.mp3,or maybe they will stick around and you'll fall in love with them
mp3/514bfb54fcfff2b7e7010824.mp3,come on just give it a try
mp3/514bff6ffcfff2b7e7010a4e.mp3,i just saw one of my favorite movies of all time on tv last night
mp3/514bff6ffcfff2b7e7010a50.mp3,space jam was on tv last night
mp3/514bff6ffcfff2b7e7010a51.mp3,space jam was that the movie that had michael jordan and the looney tunes
mp3/514bff6ffcfff2b7e7010a53.mp3,that movie was so ridiculous i guess you liked it since you're such a big basketball fan
mp3/514bff6ffcfff2b7e7010a54.mp3,the combination of cartoons and the greatest basketball player of all time what's not to like
mp3/514bff6ffcfff2b7e7010a55.mp3,i've actually never seen it before we'll have to watch it the next time it's on tv
mp3/514bff6ffcfff2b7e7010a56.mp3,you're in luck i recorded it so we can watch it tonight
mp3/514c0742fcfff2e8e402b795.mp3,so what did you think of the movie
mp3/514c0742fcfff2e8e402b796.mp3,it was pretty good i like how they mixed the cartoons with the real people
mp3/514c0742fcfff2e8e402b797.mp3,i know wasn't it so cool
mp3/514c0742fcfff2e8e402b798.mp3,but michael jordan is a pretty bad actor it's a good thing he's so good at basketball
mp3/514c0742fcfff2e8e402b79a.mp3,i can have an opinion too i just think he isn't a good actor what's wrong with that
mp3/514c0742fcfff2e8e402b79b.mp3,you can have an opinion as long as it doesn't put down michael jordan
mp3/514c0742fcfff2e8e402b79c.mp3,do you want to marry michael jordan or something
mp3/514c0742fcfff2e8e402b79d.mp3,if he asked me i would be the happiest man alive
mp3/514c0ca6fcfff26bf10253e7.mp3,what is your favorite comedy film
mp3/514c0ca6fcfff26bf10253e9.mp3,did you like the second one just as much
mp3/514c0ca6fcfff26bf10253ea.mp3,i did not like the second one very much
mp3/514c0ca6fcfff26bf10253eb.mp3,really i liked the second one more
mp3/514c0ca6fcfff26bf10253ec.mp3,the second one was the same as the first one but in thailand
mp3/514c0ca6fcfff26bf10253ed.mp3,now that you mention it it is just like the first movie
mp3/514c0ca6fcfff26bf10253ef.mp3,apparently they're making a third one too
mp3/514c0ca6fcfff26bf10253f0.mp3,i think that one is going to suck as much as the second one
mp3/514c149cfcfff21ed4026c11.mp3,how great is the toy story series
mp3/514c149cfcfff21ed4026c12.mp3,it is probably the best trilogy ever made
mp3/514c149cfcfff21ed4026c14.mp3,obviously it is between buzz light year and woody
mp3/514c149cfcfff21ed4026c15.mp3,i mean someone that isn't the main character
mp3/514c149cfcfff21ed4026c17.mp3,yeah i like rex the dinosaur
mp3/514c149cfcfff21ed4026c18.mp3,i think my favorite character is hamm the pig
mp3/514c149cfcfff21ed4026c19.mp3,actually to be honest i like all the characters that is how much i like the series
mp3/514c149cfcfff21ed4026c1a.mp3,for once i totally agree with you
mp3/514c3320fcfff2e8e402d5b4.mp3,what's the name of shreks sidekick again
mp3/514c3320fcfff2e8e402d5b7.mp3,yeah it was donkey the donkey
mp3/514c3320fcfff2e8e402d5b8.mp3,he was such a stupid character he was always getting shrek into trouble
mp3/514c3320fcfff2e8e402d5b9.mp3,yeah but he was loyal one of the morals of the movie was loyalty
mp3/514c3320fcfff2e8e402d5ba.mp3,i just couldn't stand his voice it was so irritating
mp3/514c3320fcfff2e8e402d5bb.mp3,do you like eddie murphy movies
mp3/514c3320fcfff2e8e402d5bd.mp3,that's probably why you don't like the donkey then he was voiced by eddie murphy
mp3/514c379cfcfff26bf102759b.mp3,i just watched pirates of the caribbean curse of the black pearl
mp3/514c379cfcfff26bf102759d.mp3,i think i'm going to be a pirate for halloween
mp3/514c379cfcfff26bf102759f.mp3,obviously johnny depp he's so cool
mp3/514c379cfcfff26bf10275a0.mp3,yeah most people think of captain jack sparrow
mp3/514c379cfcfff26bf10275a1.mp3,the sword fighting was so well done i can't wait to watch the other films
mp3/514c379cfcfff26bf10275a2.mp3,yeah there's three more to watch down for a movie marathon
mp3/514c379cfcfff26bf10275a4.mp3,no to pizza but yes to nachos
mp3/514c3f54fcfff21ed4028aea.mp3,would you rather have a magic carpet or a pet tiger
mp3/514c3f54fcfff21ed4028aec.mp3,not really you should pick the magic carpet
mp3/514c3f54fcfff21ed4028aed.mp3,if you already had an answer why'd you ask
mp3/514c3f54fcfff21ed4028aee.mp3,i just wanted to see if you would pick the right one
mp3/514c3f54fcfff21ed4028aef.mp3,i guess i didn't pick the right one
mp3/514c3f54fcfff21ed4028af0.mp3,you would have guessed right then
mp3/514c3f54fcfff21ed4028af2.mp3,i could fly anywhere i wanted to
mp3/514c3f54fcfff21ed4028af3.mp3,could you show me the world
mp3/514c3f54fcfff21ed4028af4.mp3,stop repeating the lines from the movie
mp3/514c5d28fcfff22d94002fb5.mp3,sam what is your favorite movie of all time
mp3/514c5d28fcfff22d94002fb6.mp3,i would have to say my favorite movie is rush hour starring jackie chan
mp3/514c5d28fcfff22d94002fb7.mp3,really that is a weird film to have as a favorite why do you like it so much
mp3/514c5d28fcfff22d94002fb8.mp3,i've always liked jackie chan movies he is so funny and he always does his own stunts
mp3/514c5d28fcfff22d94002fb9.mp3,i enjoyed the second rush hour as well
mp3/514c5d28fcfff22d94002fba.mp3,i like them all but the first one will always be my favorite one
mp3/514c5d28fcfff22d94002fbb.mp3,it's too bad jackie chan isn't making any more big hollywood films anymore
mp3/514c5d28fcfff22d94002fbc.mp3,it's ok did you know that he has been in over eighty movies i want to watch them all
mp3/514c5d28fcfff22d94002fbd.mp3,okay tell me if they are all as good as the rush hour series
mp3/514c5f89fcfff22d94003730.mp3,do you ever think that the future world that wall e took place in could really happen
mp3/514c5f89fcfff22d94003731.mp3,do you mean the setting where everyone is obese and the world is completely polluted
mp3/514c5f89fcfff22d94003732.mp3,yeah i mean i know it's a disney movie but isn't it scary that the world could turn out like that
mp3/514c5f89fcfff22d94003733.mp3,disney movies like to teach good morals so i guess this one was about being responsible people
mp3/514c5f89fcfff22d94003734.mp3,i don't ever want to become so fat that i can't walk around
mp3/514c5f89fcfff22d94003735.mp3,maybe you can get a personal robot like wall e or eve to help you move around
mp3/514c5f89fcfff22d94003736.mp3,i'm going to try to be a better person and not pollute as much
mp3/514c5f89fcfff22d94003737.mp3,that's a good idea nothing bad can come from that
mp3/514c6189fcfff22d94003baa.mp3,do you remember when you first watched jurassic park
mp3/514c6189fcfff22d94003bac.mp3,i remember because of how amazing the special effects were in that movie
mp3/514c6189fcfff22d94003bad.mp3,okay that's kind of random have you seen the special effects in movies today
mp3/514c6189fcfff22d94003bae.mp3,yeah but those are all computer graphics jurassic park used real graphics
mp3/514c6189fcfff22d94003bb0.mp3,the movie wasn't shot on a green screen it leaves something real about it
mp3/514c6189fcfff22d94003bb1.mp3,i like the modern special effects more so much more can be done with it
mp3/514c6189fcfff22d94003bb2.mp3,i disagree now movies can all be done with computers soon we won't even need actors
mp3/514c6189fcfff22d94003bb3.mp3,no way hollywood will always need real actors
mp3/514c708dfcfff2e8e4033822.mp3,no it isn't but i just bought the bluray copy and we can watch it in high definition
mp3/514c708dfcfff2e8e4033823.mp3,i'm surprised neither of us have seen it yet
mp3/514c708dfcfff2e8e4033824.mp3,considering it's the highest grossing film of all time i'm surprised too
mp3/514c708dfcfff2e8e4033826.mp3,it's basically a movie about preserving nature and not being greedy
mp3/514c708dfcfff2e8e4033827.mp3,well that doesn't sound like an original idea
mp3/514c708dfcfff2e8e4033828.mp3,it isn't the movie got high ratings because of the graphics
mp3/514c708dfcfff2e8e4033829.mp3,oh well let's go watch it the whole world can't be wrong about a movie
mp3/514d1c9ffcfff26bf103369a.mp3,so what did you think of the movie
mp3/514d1c9ffcfff26bf103369b.mp3,oh my god it was so bad
mp3/514d1c9ffcfff26bf103369c.mp3,i know right i feel the exact same way
mp3/514d1c9ffcfff26bf103369d.mp3,it was like pocahontas but with better graphics
mp3/514d1c9ffcfff26bf103369e.mp3,i don't get why people liked it so much
mp3/514d1c9ffcfff26bf103369f.mp3,maybe they just liked the shiny graphics and three dimensional effect
mp3/514d1c9ffcfff26bf10336a0.mp3,but the plot was so bad good graphics don't make a good movie
mp3/514d1c9ffcfff26bf10336a1.mp3,to some people it might it brings them into a world that they've never been in
mp3/514d1c9ffcfff26bf10336a2.mp3,i guess so but the most popular movie of all time
mp3/514d1c9ffcfff26bf10336a3.mp3,i guess we're the smart ones
mp3/514d1c9ffcfff26bf10336a4.mp3,we should probably just go watch some plays and skip the graphics altogether
mp3/514d1fa3fcfff21ed40340cf.mp3,what's better the harry potter books or the harry potter movies
mp3/514d1fa3fcfff21ed40340d0.mp3,personally i like the books more
mp3/514d1fa3fcfff21ed40340d1.mp3,yeah i think i like the books more too
mp3/514d1fa3fcfff21ed40340d2.mp3,i like the books because it lets my imagination create the world
mp3/514d1fa3fcfff21ed40340d3.mp3,that's so true the movies took away all the magic from the story
mp3/514d1fa3fcfff21ed40340d4.mp3,and there was so much more plot in the books too
mp3/514d1fa3fcfff21ed40340d5.mp3,yeah it's hard to squeeze so much content into the movies
mp3/514d1fa3fcfff21ed40340d6.mp3,i think books are better when made into tv shows that way they have more time
mp3/514d1fa3fcfff21ed40340d7.mp3,can you imagine what harry potter would be like if it was a tv show
mp3/514d1fa3fcfff21ed40340d8.mp3,wow that would be like fifteen hours of film per book
mp3/514d1fa3fcfff21ed40340d9.mp3,that would be incredible i think we should produce that tv show
mp3/514d2158fcfff26bf1033a5d.mp3,rachel i'm never going to see another chick flick with you again
mp3/514d2158fcfff26bf1033a5e.mp3,i was counting down to the premiere of twilight from the day it was announced
mp3/514d2158fcfff26bf1033a60.mp3,what didn't you like there were werewolves vampires and a hot male lead
mp3/514d2158fcfff26bf1033a61.mp3,for a chick flick it didn't have any romance
mp3/514d2158fcfff26bf1033a63.mp3,i thought she had one expression the entire film she was sad and happy all the time
mp3/514d2158fcfff26bf1033a64.mp3,it's about the hot vampires not the girl and the dream of living forever
mp3/514d2158fcfff26bf1033a65.mp3,hollywood lives off of people like you
mp3/514d2158fcfff26bf1033a66.mp3,what can i say i just like chick flicks
mp3/514d2158fcfff26bf1033a67.mp3,thank god i don't have to watch another one of those movies again
mp3/514d23a5fcfff2e8e4039b24.mp3,let's develop a scheme and rob three casinos on the same day at the same time
mp3/514d23a5fcfff2e8e4039b25.mp3,is there a single owner for all three casinos
mp3/514d23a5fcfff2e8e4039b26.mp3,yup and he's sleeping with my ex wife
mp3/514d23a5fcfff2e8e4039b27.mp3,let me guess your best friend is brad pitt
mp3/514d23a5fcfff2e8e4039b28.mp3,i wish if he was i wouldn't be here talking to you
mp3/514d23a5fcfff2e8e4039b29.mp3,if he was here i wouldn't be talking to you either
mp3/514d23a5fcfff2e8e4039b2a.mp3,george clooney or brad pitt go
mp3/514d23a5fcfff2e8e4039b2b.mp3,george clooney for someone that old he has aged beautifully
mp3/514d23a5fcfff2e8e4039b2c.mp3,i can see you drooling that's disgusting
mp3/514d23a5fcfff2e8e4039b2d.mp3,he was the leader of the group that had brad pitt and matt damon therefore he is the king
mp3/514d23a5fcfff2e8e4039b2e.mp3,okay that makes sense george clooney was the best character in the film
mp3/514d254afcfff22d9400c492.mp3,do you know what era the sound of music is set in
mp3/514d254afcfff22d9400c493.mp3,it's either during world war one or world war two i'm not sure which one though
mp3/514d254afcfff22d9400c494.mp3,did you fall asleep in history class did you not notice swastikas in the film
mp3/514d254afcfff22d9400c495.mp3,ok so it was during world war two for such an upbeat movie it really takes place during a dark time
mp3/514d254afcfff22d9400c496.mp3,yes but the film is trying to highlight how music can be a symbol of hope
mp3/514d254afcfff22d9400c497.mp3,absolutely i liked the scene where maria met the von trapp children
mp3/514d254afcfff22d9400c498.mp3,the transformation all the characters had from beginning to end was really interesting to watch
mp3/514d254afcfff22d9400c499.mp3,the captain had the most significant change of them all
mp3/514d254afcfff22d9400c49a.mp3,yeah he went from a strict captain to a loving and caring father
mp3/514d254afcfff22d9400c49b.mp3,all through the power of music
mp3/514d254afcfff22d9400c49c.mp3,ok i guess musicals aren't all that bad
mp3/514d270ffcfff21ed403474e.mp3,you're a huge super hero fan right you must have loved the avengers
mp3/514d270ffcfff21ed403474f.mp3,it's the ultimate super hero movie all the best super heroes are in it
mp3/514d270ffcfff21ed4034751.mp3,it's got to be iron man he always has something to say and his suit is awesome
mp3/514d270ffcfff21ed4034752.mp3,yeah i liked iron man too i was actually scared at the end when he almost got trapped in space
mp3/514d270ffcfff21ed4034753.mp3,iron man in trouble that's never going to happen
mp3/514d270ffcfff21ed4034754.mp3,yeah i always knew that iron man would be ok that's what he does
mp3/514d270ffcfff21ed4034755.mp3,i wonder what the next avengers movie will be about
mp3/514d270ffcfff21ed4034756.mp3,i don't know but i don't think it's going to be better than this one
mp3/514d9d69fcfff26bf103a401.mp3,ugh hit the snooze will you

mp3/514e8cf1fcfff2da9d000de9.mp3,your new promotion will mean a bigger workload  huh
mp3/514e8cf1fcfff2da9d000dea.mp3,definitely i have way more responsibilities and will oversee about half our clients
mp3/514e8cf1fcfff2da9d000deb.mp3,we spend all day at our jobs let's not talk about work

mp3/514e8f76fcfff2da9d000f8d.mp3,yeah i put it in our bathroom already
mp3/514e8f76fcfff2da9d000f8e.mp3,what should we do this weekend let's do something fun
mp3/514e8f76fcfff2da9d000f8f.mp3,i don't know i think there's a new museum downtown or we could go hiking
mp3/514e8f76fcfff2da9d000f90.mp3,i have a dentist appointment i think i have to check the calendar
mp3/514e8f76fcfff2da9d000f91.mp3,ugh better you than me i hate the dentist remember when i needed you to hold my hand
mp3/514e8f76fcfff2da9d000f92.mp3,ah you were so cute then well i'm going to bed goodnight babe
mp3/514e8f76fcfff2da9d000f93.mp3,eh screw the book i'll come to bed with you we can cuddle
mp3/51502879fcfff2e8e40605fe.mp3,oh my god i just watched the dark knight such an amazing film
mp3/51502879fcfff2e8e40605ff.mp3,sam the year is 2013 how have you not seen one of modern cinema's greatest films
mp3/51502879fcfff2e8e4060600.mp3,i guess i am behind on the times how skilled is heath ledger as an actor
mp3/51502879fcfff2e8e4060602.mp3,yeah i remember that scene what about it
mp3/51502879fcfff2e8e4060603.mp3,in the very beginning when the joker walks in alfred was supposed to have lines to say
mp3/51502879fcfff2e8e4060604.mp3,i don't remember him saying anything though
mp3/51502879fcfff2e8e4060605.mp3,that's because alfred's actor michael caine was seeing heath ledger as the joker for the first time and he was so shocked that he forgot his lines
mp3/51502879fcfff2e8e4060606.mp3,wow so he was such a good actor that he even scared the actors around him
mp3/51502879fcfff2e8e4060607.mp3,exactly it's a shame that heath ledger passed away at such an early age you should watch his other movies too
mp3/515029a7fcfff2da9d012c44.mp3,i admire forrest gump's undying spirit in the movie forrest gump
mp3/515029a7fcfff2da9d012c45.mp3,do you know if it was based on a true story
mp3/515029a7fcfff2da9d012c46.mp3,unfortunately not i don't think it's humanly possible for anyone to achieve that much in a lifetime
mp3/515029a7fcfff2da9d012c47.mp3,even though forrest gump was the main character my favorite character was bubba
mp3/515029a7fcfff2da9d012c48.mp3,what would make you come to such a conclusion
mp3/515029a7fcfff2da9d012c49.mp3,just his simple morals and inability to see the divisions of color
mp3/515029a7fcfff2da9d012c4a.mp3,well that was deep all i can remember is 50 different methods to prepare shrimp
mp3/515029a7fcfff2da9d012c4b.mp3,shrimp stew shrimp salad fried shrimp barbecued shrimp honey shrimp steamed shrimp sushi shrimp
mp3/515029a7fcfff2da9d012c4c.mp3,okay stop i get it bubba was your favorite character
mp3/515029a7fcfff2da9d012c4d.mp3,i pretty much lost interest in the whole film when he died
mp3/515029a7fcfff2da9d012c4f.mp3,you've already seen the movie don't be such a troll
mp3/51502a77fcfff2da9d012d2b.mp3,what did you think of lord of the rings
mp3/51502a77fcfff2da9d012d2c.mp3,it was kind of boring all they did was walk for most of the movie
mp3/51502a77fcfff2da9d012d2d.mp3,oh no please don't tell me you're one of those critics
mp3/51502a77fcfff2da9d012d2e.mp3,what do you mean by that
mp3/51502a77fcfff2da9d012d2f.mp3,people who say that lord of the rings was boring because all they did was walk to the mountain
mp3/51502a77fcfff2da9d012d30.mp3,well then what is it about
mp3/51502a77fcfff2da9d012d31.mp3,it's about how even the smallest person can make the biggest impact in the world
mp3/51502a77fcfff2da9d012d32.mp3,really i think you're stretching it a bit far
mp3/51502a77fcfff2da9d012d33.mp3,it's about frodo's journey through the depths of despair and how hope and goodness prevailed
mp3/51502a77fcfff2da9d012d34.mp3,honestly it was an entertaining movie but it was just dragged out to be such a long film
mp3/51502a77fcfff2da9d012d35.mp3,clearly you don't understand the underlying elements of the movie
mp3/51502b37fcfff2e8e40607b8.mp3,i think crouching tiger hidden dragon was the first chinese movie to be commercially successful in north america
mp3/51502b37fcfff2e8e40607b9.mp3,it's because it was marketed in a worldwide stage and was well produced
mp3/51502b37fcfff2e8e40607bb.mp3,it also had high-production values something that you normally don't see with most asian films
mp3/51502b37fcfff2e8e40607bd.mp3,yeah the cast was strong too chow yun-fat and michelle yeo starred in some western films too so that really helped
mp3/51502b37fcfff2e8e40607be.mp3,i guess it also benefits that the movie itself was good compared to movies in western cinema
mp3/51502b37fcfff2e8e40607bf.mp3,yup the score was good and the movie sets really displayed how beautiful china can be
mp3/51502b37fcfff2e8e40607c0.mp3,ang lee's movies haven't had the success that crouching tiger hidden dragon had but his movies are still very enjoyable
mp3/51502b37fcfff2e8e40607c1.mp3,yup there still has never been a movie like crouching tiger hidden dragon in western cinema
mp3/51502bdffcfff22d9403172d.mp3,there has never been a trilogy more disappointing than the matrix
mp3/51502bdffcfff22d9403172e.mp3,isn't that the case with most trilogies
mp3/51502bdffcfff22d9403172f.mp3,the problem is that it's hard for each movie to outdo its predecessor
mp3/51502bdffcfff22d94031730.mp3,yeah take the matrix for example the first one was so good it was almost impossible for the next two movies to be better
mp3/51502bdffcfff22d94031731.mp3,just like the original star wars trilogy and the indiana jones trilogy
mp3/51502bdffcfff22d94031732.mp3,yup it's also strange how after the matrix both keanu reeves and carrie anne moss's acting careers died
mp3/51502bdffcfff22d94031733.mp3,i didn't think they were very good actors to begin with so it isn't that surprising
mp3/51502bdffcfff22d94031734.mp3,the matrix will always be remembered for its crazy fight scenes though it was the first movie to have slow-motion fight scenes
mp3/51502bdffcfff22d94031735.mp3,the first matrix will always be one of the greatest movies of our generation
mp3/51502c8dfcfff2e8e4060899.mp3,what would you do if you were ed norton in fight club
mp3/51502c8dfcfff2e8e406089a.mp3,what do you mean by that
mp3/51502c8dfcfff2e8e406089b.mp3,i mean if you found out that someone you thought was real and was close to you was actually a figment of your imagination
mp3/51502c8dfcfff2e8e406089c.mp3,that would be mind-bending i think that's actually a real condition called schizophrenia
mp3/51502c8dfcfff2e8e406089d.mp3,scizo what can you repeat that
mp3/51502c8dfcfff2e8e406089e.mp3,schizophrenia is a condition where you imagine things that aren't real
mp3/51502c8dfcfff2e8e406089f.mp3,oh i see that sounds just like what ed norton's character had in the movie
mp3/51502c8dfcfff2e8e40608a0.mp3,yeah the movie really messes with your mind it's one of those movies that you have to watch again to really understand
mp3/51502c8dfcfff2e8e40608a1.mp3,would you say fight club is a classic movie
mp3/51502c8dfcfff2e8e40608a2.mp3,without a doubt every movie fan should watch it
mp3/51502eb3fcfff21ed4058645.mp3,do you think leonardo dicaprio was dreaming at the end of the film
mp3/51502eb3fcfff21ed4058646.mp3,i didn't think he woke up from his dream
mp3/51502eb3fcfff21ed4058647.mp3,i fully disagree because his totem was slowing down towards the end which implies that it would have fallen down
mp3/51502eb3fcfff21ed4058648.mp3,that may be but the spinning top was not his totem from the beginning that was his wife's totem
mp3/51502eb3fcfff21ed4058649.mp3,but how can you explain how he got out of limbo with saito
mp3/51502eb3fcfff21ed405864a.mp3,well i think he's been dreaming the whole time so anything can happen when you're dreaming
mp3/51502eb3fcfff21ed405864b.mp3,i think the director wanted the ending to be ambiguous so that we can have debates like this
mp3/51502eb3fcfff21ed405864c.mp3,i'm right i don't care what you say
mp3/51502eb3fcfff21ed405864d.mp3,actually you're dreaming and you just think you're right cause you've been inceptioned
mp3/51502eb3fcfff21ed405864e.mp3,inceptioned is not a real word people learning english will get confused
mp3/51502f49fcfff2e8e4060d1b.mp3,did you know that this was only the second movie that james bond got shot in
mp3/51502f49fcfff2e8e4060d1d.mp3,yeah they usually try to portray him as an indestructible human being who never gets hurt
mp3/51502f49fcfff2e8e4060d1e.mp3,the direction of skyfall was to portray bond as a normal person in many ways it personified him as james bond the person
mp3/51502f49fcfff2e8e4060d1f.mp3,that's why it is my favorite bond movie
mp3/51502f49fcfff2e8e4060d20.mp3,it was simple and plot-driven unlike the other movies that had a bunch of gadgets
mp3/51502f49fcfff2e8e4060d21.mp3,i suppose some people actually liked that style of bond more after all it had more entertainment value
mp3/51502f49fcfff2e8e4060d22.mp3,like i've always said plot is the most important element of a movie
mp3/51502fe7fcfff21ed40586bd.mp3,is it just me or does the plot resemble something that i've seen before
mp3/51502fe7fcfff21ed40586be.mp3,the departed is a remake of a hong kong hit infernal affairs
mp3/51502fe7fcfff21ed40586bf.mp3,oh the one with andy lau i love andy lau he's a very talented actor
mp3/51502fe7fcfff21ed40586c0.mp3,i wish i could agree with you but i don't speak chinese so the subtitles do a good job of speaking for him
mp3/51502fe7fcfff21ed40586c1.mp3,i preferred the ending of the departed because it brings closure to the entire movie
mp3/51502fe7fcfff21ed40586c2.mp3,the hong kong version set itself up for a sequel and because of that it wasn't as good as the us version
mp3/51502fe7fcfff21ed40586c3.mp3,if infernal affairs had the same ending as the departed i would have enjoyed it much more
mp3/51502fe7fcfff21ed40586c4.mp3,the departed had a really good cast too a-list actors everywhere
mp3/51502fe7fcfff21ed40586c5.mp3,that's probably why it was more commercially successful
mp3/51503162fcfff2e8e4060dee.mp3,what would it be like if your car could transform into a butt-kicking robot
mp3/51503162fcfff2e8e4060def.mp3,it would be great i'd never get a ticket from a cop again
mp3/51503162fcfff2e8e4060df0.mp3,you probably wouldn't need to fill up on gas either
mp3/51503162fcfff2e8e4060df1.mp3,it would be environmentally friendly and economical
mp3/51503162fcfff2e8e4060df2.mp3,the only problem is that sometimes your car would be called upon to save the world
mp3/51503162fcfff2e8e4060df3.mp3,that is a bit of an inconvenience i suppose
mp3/51503162fcfff2e8e4060df4.mp3,you would also have a carwash every week since it'll probably get really dirty from all its adventures
mp3/51503162fcfff2e8e4060df5.mp3,those would just be battle scars every warrior needs some battle scars
mp3/51503162fcfff2e8e4060df6.mp3,i can't stand a dirty car though
mp3/51503162fcfff2e8e4060df7.mp3,now you're just being trivial you wouldn't get a transforming car because you don't want to pay for a carwash
mp3/51528e5cfcfff25935004074.mp3,oh this stupid alarm i thought i had turned it off
mp3/51528e5cfcfff25935004075.mp3,i thought we were going to sleep in
mp3/51528e5cfcfff25935004076.mp3,you can but i have to run some errands
mp3/51528e5cfcfff25935004078.mp3,just boring stuff i'll see you later for brunch right

mp3/51529adbfcfff2b8d300c83b.mp3,for the health of your teeth you might want to consider cutting out sugar

mp3/51552e06fcfff28d2600e112.mp3,that's a great idea have you ever tried sichuan food before
mp3/51552e06fcfff28d2600e113.mp3,i've tried it once but it was too spicy for me
mp3/51552e06fcfff28d2600e114.mp3,trust me you will get used to it
mp3/51552e06fcfff28d2600e115.mp3,how do you eat spicy food so well
mp3/51552e06fcfff28d2600e116.mp3,i don't know it's probably because of my mom
mp3/51552e06fcfff28d2600e118.mp3,yes she adds a lot of pepper in all of her dishes
mp3/51552e06fcfff28d2600e119.mp3,haha so you really did get used to spicy food didn't you
mp3/515530bafcfff28d2600e2b7.mp3,have you decided what to order yet

mp3/515530bafcfff28d2600e2b9.mp3,i can help what are they
mp3/515530bafcfff28d2600e2bb.mp3,i would definitely choose the smoked salmon
mp3/515530bafcfff28d2600e2bc.mp3,i would too but i kind of want to try this cream spaghetti as well
mp3/515530bafcfff28d2600e2bd.mp3,dave you can't order both make your choice

mp3/51763f1ffcfff20f9e009a82.mp3,oh i wonder if i clear three dialogues a day where would i be in the ranking
mp3/51763f1ffcfff20f9e009a83.mp3,ha ha give it a try and see for yourself another ranking is for people who practice the longest every day

mp3/51767686fcfff27e64003a74.mp3,what's that rumbling noise why is the ground shaking
mp3/51767686fcfff27e64003a75.mp3,it's an earthquake jim get away from those windows
mp3/51767686fcfff27e64003a76.mp3,okay okay get under that table and hold on
mp3/51767686fcfff27e64003a77.mp3,when is the shaking going to stop
mp3/51767686fcfff27e64003a78.mp3,stay calm pam the earthquake will be over soon take a deep breath try to stay calm
mp3/51767686fcfff27e64003a79.mp3,oh my goodness that was terrifying
mp3/51767686fcfff27e64003a7a.mp3,yeah that was really scary are you okay
mp3/51767686fcfff27e64003a7b.mp3,yeah i'm okay how are you
mp3/51767686fcfff27e64003a7d.mp3,do you smell that it smells like gas what's going on
mp3/51767686fcfff27e64003a7e.mp3,oh no a gas pipe may have broken during the earthquake gas might be leaking
mp3/51767686fcfff27e64003a80.mp3,don't worry we can take care of this i'm going to shut off the gas main and i'll be right back
mp3/51767a57fcfff2cf24004361.mp3,peter did you hear about the news about the recent earthquake it's such a sad story
mp3/51767a57fcfff2cf24004362.mp3,yeah amanda it's really tragic so many people lost their homes
mp3/51767a57fcfff2cf24004364.mp3,we could start by donating some money to the red cross they are helping people rebuild their lives
mp3/51767a57fcfff2cf24004365.mp3,that's a wonderful idea what else can we do
mp3/51767a57fcfff2cf24004366.mp3,there's a clothing drive that is collecting clothes and delivering them to victims we could donate some clothes
mp3/51767a57fcfff2cf24004367.mp3,that would be really nice my sweaters could help keep a family warm
mp3/51767a57fcfff2cf24004368.mp3,yeah for sure a little goes a long way
mp3/51767a57fcfff2cf24004369.mp3,definitely let's gather some clothes to donate
mp3/51768017fcfff2fa4f0008a1.mp3,peter this recent news about earthquakes really worries me what happens if there's another earthquake
mp3/51768017fcfff2fa4f0008a2.mp3,well amanda hopefully there won't be another big earthquake soon still the best thing to do is to prepare
mp3/51768017fcfff2fa4f0008a4.mp3,i mean we'll never know when the next earthquake will happen but we can at least make sure we're as safe as possible
mp3/51768017fcfff2fa4f0008a5.mp3,i see if we can prepare ourselves before the earthquake we will know how to react how can we prepare
mp3/51768017fcfff2fa4f0008a6.mp3,first we should build an emergency kit the kit should have clean water non perishable food a first aid kit a flash
mp3/51768017fcfff2fa4f0008a7.mp3,a flashlight and extra batteries the emergency kit should also have a whistle for signaling to people
mp3/51768017fcfff2fa4f0008a9.mp3,okay so after we make our emergency kit what do we do
mp3/51768017fcfff2fa4f0008aa.mp3,we need to put our emergency kit someplace that we can easily get to in an emergency
mp3/51768017fcfff2fa4f0008ab.mp3,all right i think we're all set i feel so much better now now that we're more prepared
mp3/51768017fcfff2fa4f0008ac.mp3,i'm so happy to hear that we've taken a good step at being more prepared there are still a few more things we can do
mp3/51768373fcfff28c37000fb2.mp3,so peter what are some other ways we can prepare for an earthquake
mp3/51768373fcfff28c37000fb3.mp3,that's a great question amanda there are many ways we can be safer
mp3/51768373fcfff28c37000fb5.mp3,okay we could start by putting latches on our cabinet doors
mp3/51768373fcfff28c37000fb6.mp3,that's a good idea that way if there's a lot of shaking our dishes will stay in the cabinets instead of falling out
mp3/51768373fcfff28c37000fb7.mp3,exactly we should also check our home's electrical wiring and gas pipes
mp3/51768373fcfff28c37000fb8.mp3,oh those could be a fire hazard if there's anything wrong with them we should get a repairman to fix them
mp3/51768373fcfff28c37000fb9.mp3,definitely we should also get the kids and have an earthquake drill
mp3/51768373fcfff28c37000fbb.mp3,well our whole family should pretend like there's an earthquake happening and practice what to do
mp3/51768373fcfff28c37000fbc.mp3,oh that's smart so if there's a real earthquake instead of panicking we'll know what to do
mp3/51768373fcfff28c37000fbd.mp3,that's exactly right i'll go get the kids and we can practice right now
mp3/5176884afcfff28c3700256d.mp3,quick let's get out of here
mp3/5176884afcfff28c3700256e.mp3,get down low and crawl so you can avoid breathing smoke
mp3/5176884afcfff28c37002570.mp3,where are you going don't use the elevator
mp3/5176884afcfff28c37002571.mp3,what how should we get out of here
mp3/5176884afcfff28c37002572.mp3,use the emergency exit stairs follow the green exit signs
mp3/5176884afcfff28c37002574.mp3,wait check the door handle before you open the door if it's hot there might be a fire on the other side
mp3/5176884afcfff28c37002575.mp3,the door handle feels cool i'm going to open the door now
mp3/5176884afcfff28c37002576.mp3,okay let's go down these stairs

mp3/517dda0dfcfff2d1eb00dfc6.mp3,no no no it would be too tempting to buy something i don't want the temptation

mp3/5184f8affcfff259aa01fb58.mp3,i thought you said you didn't remember me being there

mp3/5184fa9ffcfff2f39701f8aa.mp3,i have my own set of keys you can watch me lock up
mp3/5184fbfafcfff259aa020560.mp3,oh nothing i'm just so happy to have a home cooked meal it just needs a little salt
mp3/5184fbfafcfff259aa020562.mp3,no just a just a pinch
mp3/5184fbfafcfff259aa020563.mp3,you haven't changed a bit you always have to be in control
mp3/5184fbfafcfff259aa020564.mp3,hmmm well i don't remember you complaining
mp3/5184fbfafcfff259aa020565.mp3,well i wasn't allowed to it was one of your rules
mp3/5184fbfafcfff259aa020566.mp3,i may hold the reins a little tight but life is complicated especially once you have kids one day the wall goes up
mp3/5184fbfafcfff259aa020567.mp3,well they don't like to admit it but they want us to break through
mp3/5184fd71fcfff259aa020b46.mp3,you're awfully concerned about a fourteen year old boy breaking curfew
mp3/5184fd71fcfff259aa020b47.mp3,well it's not my curfew he's breaking he's been staying at the ostroff center
mp3/5184fd71fcfff259aa020b4b.mp3,um no he's not a bad kid he's just just um a lonely one
mp3/5184fd71fcfff259aa020b4d.mp3,bad enough to try to kill himself
mp3/5184fe9bfcfff259aa020e7e.mp3,well i can see why your brother would want to leave that place is uh is very depressing
mp3/5184fe9bfcfff259aa020e7f.mp3,and yet it's designed to treat depression
mp3/5184fe9bfcfff259aa020e80.mp3,he's a good kid eric he is
mp3/5184fe9bfcfff259aa020e81.mp3,yeah jenny's not so bad either
mp3/5184fe9bfcfff259aa020e82.mp3,i just worry about her sometimes
mp3/5184fe9bfcfff259aa020e83.mp3,look i've seen jenny in action and my hunch is she doesn't let herself get pushed in anything she doesn't want to do
mp3/5184fe9bfcfff259aa020e84.mp3,she's never mentioned that her idea of a great friday night consists of hanging out with a bunch of drunk wall streeters
mp3/5184fe9bfcfff259aa020e85.mp3,well maybe that wasn't her idea of a great friday night
mp3/5184fe9bfcfff259aa020e87.mp3,it's okay for her to want to be friends with the people she goes to school with
mp3/5184fe9bfcfff259aa020e89.mp3,uh huh and if you made half the effort she did maybe we would have met a long time ago
mp3/5184fe9bfcfff259aa020e8b.mp3,then so maybe you would have kissed me already
mp3/5184fffbfcfff259aa02140e.mp3,so kati mentioned something about a custom made corset and i hear there are wigs involved
mp3/5184fffbfcfff259aa02140f.mp3,it's a masquerade you have to conceal your identity but i do have something special planned for nate tonight it's a game
mp3/5184fffbfcfff259aa021411.mp3,if he finds me before midnight when the masks come off he can claim his prize
mp3/5184fffbfcfff259aa021412.mp3,and what's that oh yeah right sorry
mp3/5184fffbfcfff259aa021413.mp3,i just figured that after everything that's happened or hasn't happened i should find some way to make it special
mp3/5184fffbfcfff259aa021414.mp3,well that's really romantic blair really look um if you don't want me to come tonight i totally understand
mp3/5184fffbfcfff259aa021415.mp3,what no i want you to come in fact i was hoping you would be one of my ladies would you give nate the last clue

mp3/518502b7fcfff2f397021a5c.mp3,cause they sort of are uh the man at the store lent it to me
mp3/518502b7fcfff2f397021a5d.mp3,why would he do that oh oh sweetie you didn't think you were going to be able to come tonight right
mp3/518502b7fcfff2f397021a5f.mp3,jenny freshmen don't get to go to the masked ball it's just tradition
mp3/518502b7fcfff2f397021a60.mp3,no i know it's just that there were five dresses
mp3/518502b7fcfff2f397021a61.mp3,you always need backup i mean what what if i spilled something or a zipper broke
mp3/518502b7fcfff2f397021a62.mp3,yeah of course i'll i'll remember that have fun tonight
mp3/518502b7fcfff2f397021a63.mp3,i will and don't worry your time will come i promise now if you'll excuse me i have to get ready
mp3/5185b798fcfff2116912d2c0.mp3,do you remember i was applying for a new job
mp3/5185b798fcfff2116912d2c2.mp3,i heard back from a few companies that offered me interviews
mp3/5185b798fcfff2116912d2c7.mp3,well now you have to research the backgrounds of the companies and think about why they should hire you
mp3/5185b798fcfff2116912d2c8.mp3,you're right the hard work begins now
mp3/5185b952fcfff2f9e513f78c.mp3,do you know what a star interview is
mp3/5185b952fcfff2f9e513f78d.mp3,oh yeah i'm a star in all of my interviews
mp3/5185b952fcfff2f9e513f78e.mp3,ha ha no no star interviewing is a type of job interview technique
mp3/5185b952fcfff2f9e513f78f.mp3,oh i see so what does star stand for
mp3/5185b952fcfff2f9e513f790.mp3,star stands for situation task action result to start an interviewer will ask you about a specific situation in the past
mp3/5185b952fcfff2f9e513f791.mp3,okay so the interviewer might ask me about a situation at my old job like the last time i worked in a team
mp3/5185b952fcfff2f9e513f792.mp3,exactly and then the interviewer might ask you about a task something you wanted to achieve
mp3/5185b952fcfff2f9e513f793.mp3,so she might ask me about a task my team wanted to achieve like when we wanted to develop last year's budget
mp3/5185b952fcfff2f9e513f794.mp3,yup then the interviewer will want to know what actions you took to achieve your goal
mp3/5185b952fcfff2f9e513f795.mp3,then i'd have to tell the interviewer that we had meetings worked with the c f o and things like that right
mp3/5185b952fcfff2f9e513f796.mp3,that's right and then the interviewer will ask about the result
mp3/5185b952fcfff2f9e513f797.mp3,i see so i'd have to say if we succeeded or failed in developing our budget
mp3/5185b952fcfff2f9e513f798.mp3,yeah you seem to know a lot about star interviews
mp3/5185b952fcfff2f9e513f799.mp3,like i said i'm a star
mp3/5185ba10fcfff2116912da08.mp3,are you ready for your interview
mp3/5185ba10fcfff2116912da09.mp3,i'm a little nervous i don't know what to say
mp3/5185ba10fcfff2116912da0a.mp3,that's okay we can think about this together
mp3/5185ba10fcfff2116912da0b.mp3,that would be great i know a common question is what are your strengths right
mp3/5185ba10fcfff2116912da0d.mp3,i want to tell the interviewer that i'm smart and i like numbers
mp3/5185ba10fcfff2116912da0e.mp3,sure you're smart and you are good at math how can you prove to the interviewer that you really are though
mp3/5185ba10fcfff2116912da0f.mp3,i could tell him about a time when i had to use excel for a work project
mp3/5185ba10fcfff2116912da11.mp3,then i could tell the interviewer about all the excel formulas that i had to make
mp3/5185ba10fcfff2116912da13.mp3,lastly i could say how my formulas helped make the project succeed and that my boss told me i did a good job
mp3/5185ba10fcfff2116912da14.mp3,nice i think you'll do great in this interview
mp3/5185babefcfff2116912db80.mp3,i feel so unprepared for my interview
mp3/5185babefcfff2116912db81.mp3,how can we change that do you think practicing would help
mp3/5185babefcfff2116912db82.mp3,yeah i think practicing could help but i don't know how to practice
mp3/5185babefcfff2116912db83.mp3,well we could have a mock interview i could role play as the interviewer and you could pretend to be the interviewee
mp3/5185babefcfff2116912db84.mp3,oh that's great i like that idea
mp3/5185babefcfff2116912db85.mp3,we could also film our practices that way you can review to see what's good and what needs improvement
mp3/5185babefcfff2116912db86.mp3,wonderful that would also help me improve my body language
mp3/5185babefcfff2116912db87.mp3,yeah i think it would help
mp3/5185babefcfff2116912db88.mp3,okay time to practice practice practice you get a video camera and i'll set up some chairs
mp3/5185bc1efcfff2116912df65.mp3,thanks so much for helping me prepare for my interview
mp3/5185bc1efcfff2116912df66.mp3,of course okay let's get started my first question is tell me about your strengths

mp3/5185bc1efcfff2116912df68.mp3,okay tell me about a time you worked on a team
mp3/5185bc1efcfff2116912df69.mp3,for my last project i worked on a team of ten colleagues
mp3/5185bc1efcfff2116912df6b.mp3,our team had to develop a marketing plan
mp3/5185bc1efcfff2116912df6d.mp3,there was no clear leader so people were confused i held a meeting with the team and we brainstormed roles
mp3/5185bc1efcfff2116912df6e.mp3,and what happened in the end
mp3/5185bc1efcfff2116912df6f.mp3,we developed a marketing plan and presented it to our boss he liked it and told me i had worked well with everyone
mp3/5185bc1efcfff2116912df70.mp3,i think this practice is definitely helping a lot good job
mp3/5185bd00fcfff2f39703ae1c.mp3,i really enjoy practicing with you for my interview thank you so much
mp3/5185bd00fcfff2f39703ae1d.mp3,no problem are you ready for my next practice question

mp3/5185bd00fcfff2f39703ae20.mp3,i felt really stressed when my manager said i had to give a presentation to my c e o
mp3/5185bd00fcfff2f39703ae22.mp3,my team had developed a new product and i had to present it to the c e o i was so nervous
mp3/5185bd00fcfff2f39703ae24.mp3,before the presentation i worked on a p p t for ten hours then i practiced my presentation for two hours a day
mp3/5185bd00fcfff2f39703ae26.mp3,the presentation was a success the c e o liked my team's new product and he complemented me on my presentation skills
mp3/5185bd00fcfff2f39703ae27.mp3,all right how do you think that practice went
mp3/5185bd00fcfff2f39703ae28.mp3,i think it went well but i still need more practice
mp3/5185bda4fcfff2f9e51405df.mp3,did i tell you that my interview is going to be on skype
mp3/5185bda4fcfff2f9e51405e1.mp3,i guess but i have no idea what to do in a skype interview
mp3/5185bda4fcfff2f9e51405e2.mp3,okay well let's think about some things you can do to have a successful skype interview
mp3/5185bda4fcfff2f9e51405e3.mp3,sure i guess i should treat it just as seriously as an in person interview
mp3/5185bda4fcfff2f9e51405e4.mp3,definitely so you'll want to be on time and dress professionally what else
mp3/5185bda4fcfff2f9e51405e5.mp3,well since it's on skype i should check that my microphone and video camera are working properly
mp3/5185bda4fcfff2f9e51405e6.mp3,yeah that's a great idea anything else what about your alias
mp3/5185bda4fcfff2f9e51405e7.mp3,oh yeah instead of devil eighty eight i should change my alias to be something more professional i could use my real name
mp3/5185bda4fcfff2f9e51405e8.mp3,ha ha that's a good idea
mp3/5185be25fcfff259aa03c1aa.mp3,my interview is tomorrow i'm so nervous
mp3/5185be25fcfff259aa03c1ab.mp3,i know how you feel you're going to do fine you've spent a lot of time preparing for your interview
mp3/5185be25fcfff259aa03c1ac.mp3,yeah i've been preparing a lot i researched the company and we did a lot of mock interviews together
mp3/5185be25fcfff259aa03c1ad.mp3,indeed just remember a few things like have a firm confident handshake when you meet the interviewer
mp3/5185be25fcfff259aa03c1ae.mp3,okay that's important i guess i should also be on time
mp3/5185be25fcfff259aa03c1af.mp3,definitely you should be at the office fifteen minutes before your interview that way you won't feel rushed
mp3/5185be25fcfff259aa03c1b0.mp3,that's a good idea i also need to remember to look the interviewer in the eye
mp3/5185be25fcfff259aa03c1b1.mp3,yup eye contact is important just be careful not to stare
mp3/5185d787fcfff2f397040858.mp3,so what do you think i should wear for my interview tomorrow
mp3/5185d787fcfff2f397040859.mp3,well you should probably dress professionally
mp3/5185d787fcfff2f39704085a.mp3,sure but what does that mean what would you wear
mp3/5185d787fcfff2f39704085b.mp3,uhh i'm a girl so i would probably wear different clothes than you would
mp3/5185d787fcfff2f39704085c.mp3,i know i know but help give me an idea
mp3/5185d787fcfff2f39704085d.mp3,okay i would wear either a dress that goes past my knees or a suit jacket and skirt
mp3/5185d787fcfff2f39704085e.mp3,well i guess i could wear a suit too right
mp3/5185d787fcfff2f39704085f.mp3,definitely suits are professional don't forget to wear a tie
mp3/5185d787fcfff2f397040860.mp3,okay a suit and tie anything else
mp3/5185d787fcfff2f397040861.mp3,oh and dress shoes of course

mp3/5190575cfcfff2b1a30fa714.mp3,another question i'd like to ask you is what's a recent challenge that you've had to overcome
mp3/5190575cfcfff2b1a30fa715.mp3,that's a great question pam would you like to hear about a personal or work related challenge
mp3/5190575cfcfff2b1a30fa717.mp3,okay my boss came to me a few months ago and told me my sales team had a new target to increase revenue by twenty percent
mp3/5190575cfcfff2b1a30fa719.mp3,that was a big challenge so i gathered my team for a meeting we spent an afternoon thinking of ways to increase sales
mp3/5190575cfcfff2b1a30fa71b.mp3,we thought that if we offered a ten percent discount we could improve sales by thirty percent and hit our revenue target
mp3/5190575cfcfff2b1a30fa71d.mp3,our plan worked the discount improved our sales and we reached our sales target my boss was really happy
mp3/5190594ffcfff2df3f0f9c8f.mp3,tim what is something your boss would like you to improve on
mp3/5190594ffcfff2df3f0f9c90.mp3,hmmm that's a good question pam let me think
mp3/5190594ffcfff2df3f0f9c92.mp3,during my last performance evaluation my boss told me that he wanted me to write my emails more professionally
mp3/5190594ffcfff2df3f0f9c93.mp3,was there a problem with your emails
mp3/5190594ffcfff2df3f0f9c94.mp3,i had gotten lazy with my punctuation and spelling i would write business emails like text messages
mp3/5190594ffcfff2df3f0f9c96.mp3,so i changed i started using correct grammar and spell check my boss was much happier and so were my clients
mp3/5190594ffcfff2df3f0f9c97.mp3,that sounds like a happy ending
mp3/5190594ffcfff2df3f0f9c98.mp3,yeah it is and my sales improved too
mp3/51905d72fcfff2216d0f8cf5.mp3,tim we like to think long term at this company
mp3/51905d72fcfff2216d0f8cf7.mp3,so i'd like to ask you if we hired you now in a year from now how would we know that we'd made the right decision
mp3/51905d72fcfff2216d0f8cf8.mp3,good question in a year i hope to have shown my value by increasing sales revenue
mp3/51905d72fcfff2216d0f8cfa.mp3,i'd start by working closely with the sales team to develop a one year plan
mp3/51905d72fcfff2216d0f8cfc.mp3,then we'd have meetings every month to make sure that we achieved our goals
mp3/51905d72fcfff2216d0f8cfe.mp3,additionally i would give bonuses to my team's top salespeople i would do my best to motivate my team

mp3/5191c893fcfff2229400553d.mp3,believe me your feelings are just as important as hers
mp3/5191c893fcfff2229400553e.mp3,no that doesn't sound right either

mp3/5191cb0ffcfff27eea00592f.mp3,yes see of the handful of women leonard's been involved with she's the only one i have ever found tolerable
mp3/5191cb0ffcfff27eea005933.mp3,anyway should you have any interaction with her it would be most helpful that she not see you as a sexual rival
mp3/5191cb0ffcfff27eea005934.mp3,yeah i think she's pretty safe
mp3/5191cb0ffcfff27eea005935.mp3,consider the following scenario you're alone and suddenly even leonard seems like a viable sexual candidate
mp3/5191cb0ffcfff27eea005937.mp3,yes now should that happen i would ask you to find some way to suppress your libido

mp3/51a176f3fcfff2680800527d.mp3,seeing if we can get the signal from high ground
mp3/51a1787dfcfff2208b004c58.mp3,sayid fixed the transceiver but we can't use it not from here

mp3/51a22e43fcfff28aa400a208.mp3,my interviewer told me that i would hear back in one week
mp3/51a22e43fcfff28aa400a209.mp3,oh that's great have you followed up with your interviewer yet
mp3/51a22e43fcfff28aa400a20d.mp3,definitely you want to thank your interviewer for his time and also remind him of how you can bring value to his company
mp3/51a22e43fcfff28aa400a20e.mp3,that's a great idea i'll write to my interviewer right now
mp3/51a22eb1fcfff2c77200aca1.mp3,jessica what do you think i should write in my note to my interviewer
mp3/51a22eb1fcfff2c77200aca2.mp3,well what's the purpose of writing this note
mp3/51a22eb1fcfff2c77200aca3.mp3,i guess it's so i can remind the interviewer of who i am and why he should hire me
mp3/51a22eb1fcfff2c77200aca4.mp3,that's right i bet your interviewer talked to dozens of candidates it can be hard to remember who is who
mp3/51a22eb1fcfff2c77200aca5.mp3,okay first i will thank my interviewer for spending time talking to me
mp3/51a22eb1fcfff2c77200aca7.mp3,then i will recap my strengths and say how i can help make the company better
mp3/51a22eb1fcfff2c77200aca8.mp3,i love it i also think you should handwrite your note
mp3/51a22eb1fcfff2c77200aca9.mp3,what i'm just going to email my interviewer who writes handwritten notes nowadays
mp3/51a22eb1fcfff2c77200acaa.mp3,exactly if you send a handwritten note it's classy and will make a memorable impression
mp3/51a2be11fcfff22a5a00c069.mp3,hey jenny how did your interview go earlier this week
mp3/51a2be11fcfff22a5a00c06b.mp3,that's good have you heard any news yet

mp3/51a2be11fcfff22a5a00c06e.mp3,they told me they would give me a decision in the next three days i'm really nervous though
mp3/51a2be11fcfff22a5a00c070.mp3,i want to write my interviewer an email to make sure he got my first note
mp3/51a2be11fcfff22a5a00c071.mp3,if you haven't heard back from them yet you might want to wait before you email them again
mp3/51a2be11fcfff22a5a00c073.mp3,well you don't want to annoy the interviewer before he makes a decision to hire you
mp3/51a2be98fcfff253ef00bbb1.mp3,congratulations rebecca we'd like to offer you a position at our company

mp3/51a2bf2afcfff284a000b5bb.mp3,also is it possible to get a signing bonus
mp3/51a2bf2afcfff284a000b5bc.mp3,we could review that as well how much of a bonus are you looking for
mp3/51a2bf2afcfff284a000b5bd.mp3,i think in the range of 15 percent of my salary would be a fair amount
mp3/51a2bf2afcfff284a000b5be.mp3,okay let me speak with our vice president and confirm with her

mp3/51aae335fcfff2e281018e21.mp3,but it takes months before the movies come out on dvd
mp3/51aae335fcfff2e281018e22.mp3,yeah that's true okay let's go to the movie theater
mp3/51aae3ecfcfff2e281018e5e.mp3,i hate the actor who plays the main character
mp3/51aae3ecfcfff2e281018e60.mp3,i just don't like him the costar is good though
mp3/51aae3ecfcfff2e281018e62.mp3,i like the classic actors the best from old movies
mp3/51aae3ecfcfff2e281018e63.mp3,i think a lot of modern actresses are talented
mp3/51ab15e9fcfff2119201410e.mp3,my favorite kind of movie is one with good characters
mp3/51ab15e9fcfff2119201410f.mp3,yeah they have to be believable
mp3/51ab15e9fcfff21192014110.mp3,i almost fell in love in a movie once
mp3/51ab15e9fcfff21192014111.mp3,the lead actor was that good huh
mp3/51ab15e9fcfff21192014112.mp3,yeah he broke my heart too
mp3/51ab15e9fcfff21192014113.mp3,and there are some characters that you love to hate right
mp3/51ab15e9fcfff21192014115.mp3,those characters are the best i think
mp3/51ab166afcfff280d3019302.mp3,oh no all the movies are sold out
mp3/51ab166afcfff280d3019303.mp3,that sucks what should we do
mp3/51ab166afcfff280d3019304.mp3,do you want to go to the movie store and rent one
mp3/51ab166afcfff280d3019305.mp3,okay there are some newly released movies
mp3/51ab166afcfff280d3019306.mp3,they are new to dvd right they were just in the theaters
mp3/51ab166afcfff280d3019307.mp3,yeah it's cheap to rent movies
mp3/51ab166afcfff280d3019308.mp3,okay we can watch one at my house
mp3/51ab16dafcfff2e281019d66.mp3,that one was a hit at the box office
mp3/51ab16dafcfff2e281019d67.mp3,what's the point of the box office
mp3/51ab16dafcfff2e281019d68.mp3,they keep track of how much money a movie has made
mp3/51ab16dafcfff2e281019d69.mp3,so if a movie makes a lot of money it's obviously popular
mp3/51ab16dafcfff2e281019d6a.mp3,right and popular movies are usually good
mp3/51ab1748fcfff2b325016f3a.mp3,what kind of movie are you in the mood to watch
mp3/51ab1748fcfff2b325016f3c.mp3,no they are just too scary i don't like to watch people get killed
mp3/51ab1748fcfff2b325016f3f.mp3,gross i don't like to watch people fall in love
mp3/51ab1748fcfff2b325016f40.mp3,fine let's look for a different one
mp3/51ab17bbfcfff2a577013eae.mp3,this movie is supposed to be great
mp3/51ab17bbfcfff2a577013eaf.mp3,oh yeah it's a big budget movie
mp3/51ab17bbfcfff2a577013eb0.mp3,so it was really expensive to make
mp3/51ab17bbfcfff2a577013eb1.mp3,yeah big budget movies usually have expensive actors
mp3/51ab17bbfcfff2a577013eb3.mp3,they're always fun to watch let's get it
mp3/51ab1886fcfff27786019324.mp3,oh can we rent that one instead
mp3/51ab1886fcfff27786019326.mp3,chick flicks are romantic comedies how is that bad
mp3/51ab1886fcfff27786019327.mp3,it's called a chick flick because only chicks or girls like them
mp3/51ab1886fcfff27786019329.mp3,not many i don't want to watch a chick flick
mp3/51ab1b99fcfff280d3019490.mp3,one of these nights we should have a movie night
mp3/51ab1b99fcfff280d3019492.mp3,no a movie night is when you watch more than one movie
mp3/51ab1b99fcfff280d3019494.mp3,that makes sense a really long time to watch tv
mp3/51ab1b99fcfff280d3019495.mp3,yeah they're fun once in a while
mp3/51ab1b99fcfff280d3019496.mp3,you wouldn't want to have too many movie marathons though
mp3/51ab1b99fcfff280d3019497.mp3,yeah too much tv isn't always good

mp3/51b680a9fcfff2f1ea014552.mp3,well i'm discovering that some of them treat it as a competitive sport and others i think just need the validation
mp3/51b680a9fcfff2f1ea014553.mp3,and probably others just have a thing for exceptionally beautiful women
mp3/51b680a9fcfff2f1ea014555.mp3,and there's something wrong with that
mp3/51b680a9fcfff2f1ea014556.mp3,no there's nothing wrong i just think it might become a bit monotonous

mp3/51b686b3fcfff289f6013d3d.mp3,no i'm all done with casual sex from now on i'm fully committed to the traditional relationship paradigm
mp3/51b686b3fcfff289f6013d3f.mp3,there's just a time in every woman's life when she gets tired of waking up on a strange futon with a bunch of people she doesn't know
mp3/51b686b3fcfff289f6013d40.mp3,yeah i can see how that would a bunch of people

mp3/51b688a3fcfff263760150be.mp3,well have you asked him about it
mp3/51b688a3fcfff263760150bf.mp3,yeah i wish he'd be honest with me it's like he and my mom they made some secret pact to act like robots
mp3/51b688a3fcfff263760150c0.mp3,yeah well i don't think that pact is so secret i think all of our parents signed it
mp3/51b688a3fcfff263760150c1.mp3,but i'm not a little kid anymore he doesn't have to shut me out
mp3/51b688a3fcfff263760150c2.mp3,look if what you think is right he's probably really scared hey don't give up okay

mp3/51b83b69fcfff295b001dd9c.mp3,well comedy will always be popular
mp3/51b83b69fcfff295b001dd9f.mp3,but it doesn't have deep themes
mp3/51b83b69fcfff295b001dda0.mp3,i think that's okay real life is deep enough
mp3/51b83bbcfcfff289f601cd6a.mp3,i know that's what makes it so good

mp3/51b83c27fcfff2686901dbc4.mp3,what makes a tv show a classic
mp3/51b83c27fcfff2686901dbc5.mp3,a show is a classic when it is still popular long after it has ended
mp3/51b83c27fcfff2686901dbc6.mp3,so what are some classic tv shows
mp3/51b83c27fcfff2686901dbc7.mp3,a lot of comedy shows are classics

mp3/51b83c27fcfff2686901dbc9.mp3,yes seinfeld was new and interesting then and still is
mp3/51b83c27fcfff2686901dbca.mp3,some of the classics are even in black and white
mp3/51b83c89fcfff2dba101f05a.mp3,tv is all about showing what is popular
mp3/51b83c89fcfff2dba101f05c.mp3,they also reflect what society loves
mp3/51b83c89fcfff2dba101f05d.mp3,that seems to change all the time
mp3/51b83c89fcfff2dba101f05e.mp3,that's why there's always something new on tv
mp3/51b83df7fcfff2637601f99a.mp3,there is a series premiere on tonight
mp3/51b83df7fcfff2637601f99c.mp3,it's for a show called the mindy project
mp3/51b83df7fcfff2637601f99d.mp3,oh i've heard that's supposed to be just okay
mp3/51b83df7fcfff2637601f99e.mp3,the series premiere is the first episode of the whole show
mp3/51b83df7fcfff2637601f99f.mp3,so you're saying we should watch it
mp3/51b83df7fcfff2637601f9a0.mp3,yes we have to give it a chance
mp3/51b83ef0fcfff295b001dee4.mp3,we have to watch the show that's on next
mp3/51b83ef0fcfff295b001dee6.mp3,it's the season finale of my favorite show
mp3/51b83ef0fcfff295b001dee7.mp3,ah the last episode of the season
mp3/51b83ef0fcfff295b001dee8.mp3,yes all the plots will be finished
mp3/51b83ef0fcfff295b001dee9.mp3,we'll know what happens to all the characters
mp3/51b84060fcfff293c401d614.mp3,whatever happened to that show that i liked
mp3/51b84060fcfff293c401d617.mp3,it got dropped by the tv network
mp3/51b84060fcfff293c401d619.mp3,yeah it got cancelled in the middle of the season
mp3/51b84060fcfff293c401d61a.mp3,so no one except me liked it
mp3/51b84e31fcfff2d6fb01ea1d.mp3,i love when a show has a cliffhanger at the end
mp3/51b84e31fcfff2d6fb01ea1f.mp3,i love wondering what will happen next
mp3/51b84e31fcfff2d6fb01ea20.mp3,i just want to know how things end
mp3/51b84e31fcfff2d6fb01ea21.mp3,cliffhangers are so smart to do
mp3/51b84e31fcfff2d6fb01ea22.mp3,yeah the show ends at a really suspenseful part
mp3/51b84e31fcfff2d6fb01ea23.mp3,so that you have to tune in next week
mp3/51b84eccfcfff26376020035.mp3,i know the oscars celebrate film but what celebrates tv
mp3/51b84eccfcfff26376020036.mp3,the golden globes and the emmy awards
mp3/51b84eccfcfff26376020039.mp3,and the golden globes celebrate tv and movies right
mp3/51b84eccfcfff2637602003a.mp3,that's right these awards aren't as famous as the oscars
mp3/51b84eccfcfff2637602003b.mp3,but it would still be pretty special to get one
mp3/51b97765fcfff2bc670002b3.mp3,what do you have going on this weekend val
mp3/51b97765fcfff2bc670002b4.mp3,i am speaking at an international business conference in shanghai
mp3/51b97765fcfff2bc670002b6.mp3,yes it is an annual conference with the top businessmen and women in the world
mp3/51b97765fcfff2bc670002b8.mp3,yes i will be giving a talk on human relations
mp3/51b97765fcfff2bc670002b9.mp3,good luck that's a huge honor
mp3/51b9781afcfff2e0f600062e.mp3,so tell me more about this speaking engagement
mp3/51b9781afcfff2e0f600062f.mp3,the board for the conference asked me last year to give the talk
mp3/51b9781afcfff2e0f6000630.mp3,did they ask you to speak this year also
mp3/51b9781afcfff2e0f6000631.mp3,yes my talk was very popular and useful for companies
mp3/51b9781afcfff2e0f6000632.mp3,how many people are in the audience
mp3/51b9781afcfff2e0f6000633.mp3,about 3000 people from all over the world
mp3/51b9781afcfff2e0f6000635.mp3,i used to but speaking with confidence has helped me
mp3/51b9788ffcfff2e41b000410.mp3,is it difficult to get along with people from other countries
mp3/51b9788ffcfff2e41b000411.mp3,not at all you treat everyone with respect
mp3/51b9788ffcfff2e41b000412.mp3,but business etiquette must be different for every culture
mp3/51b9788ffcfff2e41b000413.mp3,that is true for example the chinese value friendship in business americans not as much
mp3/51b9788ffcfff2e41b000414.mp3,i bet that's difficult to try to understand everyone
mp3/51b9788ffcfff2e41b000415.mp3,that is what my talk is about i will teach people business etiquette
mp3/51b979dffcfff20a990003cc.mp3,i bet it's expensive to fly to shanghai
mp3/51b979dffcfff20a990003cd.mp3,it is but my company pays for it
mp3/51b979dffcfff20a990003cf.mp3,plus i have frequent flier miles
mp3/51b979dffcfff20a990003d0.mp3,wow so you must do a lot of international business for your company
mp3/51b979dffcfff20a990003d1.mp3,yes i speak at business conferences all over the world throughout the year
mp3/51b979dffcfff20a990003d2.mp3,no wonder you have so many frequent flier miles

mp3/51b97e71fcfff20f8d000996.mp3,they set this party up so that we could all talk to each other
mp3/51b97e71fcfff20f8d000997.mp3,that's a good thing people can network
mp3/51b97e71fcfff20f8d000999.mp3,networking is meeting and connecting with people
mp3/51b97e71fcfff20f8d00099a.mp3,i guess that can be good for business
mp3/51b97e71fcfff20f8d00099b.mp3,absolutely we say in america it's not what you know it's who you know
mp3/51b97e71fcfff20f8d00099c.mp3,i guess meeting and making connections is a good idea
mp3/51b97edefcfff2e0f600086f.mp3,to be honest i don't like cocktail parties
mp3/51b97edefcfff2e0f6000871.mp3,you are expected to mingle and talk to everyone
mp3/51b97edefcfff2e0f6000872.mp3,are you more of a quiet man
mp3/51b97edefcfff2e0f6000873.mp3,i'd rather talk to one person than twenty that's for sure
mp3/51b97edefcfff2e0f6000874.mp3,well it's a good way to meet people to network
mp3/51b97edefcfff2e0f6000876.mp3,yes there is well i'm going to mingle see you later

mp3/51bc29affcfff228d800635b.mp3,i'd like to order broadband internet for my laptop
mp3/51bc29affcfff228d800635c.mp3,just plug the ethernet cable into your computer and a prompt will tell you the payment options
mp3/51bc29affcfff228d800635d.mp3,i don't have an ethernet port my computer runs entirely on wifi
mp3/51bc29affcfff228d800635e.mp3,that's too bad but there are several alternatives if you want to hear them
mp3/51bc29affcfff228d800635f.mp3,yes please tell me about the alternatives
mp3/51bc29affcfff228d8006360.mp3,we run a fully equipped computer lab on the first floor
mp3/51bc29affcfff228d8006361.mp3,that's great how much does that cost
mp3/51bc29affcfff228d8006362.mp3,the service is free to hotel patrons however printing costs ten cents per page
mp3/51bc29affcfff228d8006363.mp3,i see and the other alternatives
mp3/51bc29affcfff228d8006364.mp3,alternatively we do offer wireless in our lobby you can bring your laptop down here

mp3/51bc2a24fcfff2eb360093cd.mp3,i think i'll explore new york some more but i need to store my bags
mp3/51bc2a24fcfff2eb360093ce.mp3,sir our storage facility is merely \$5 an hour you also need to leave a deposit
mp3/51bc2a24fcfff2eb360093cf.mp3,my luggage isn't enough of a deposit
mp3/51bc2a24fcfff2eb360093d0.mp3,unfortunately it isn't visa or mastercard will suffice though
mp3/51bc2a24fcfff2eb360093d1.mp3,let me think for a moment
mp3/51bc2cadfcfff240bf0032f9.mp3,i'm going to need a taxi
mp3/51bc2cadfcfff240bf0032fa.mp3,you don't have to restrict yourself to a taxi we can offer you a private vehicle
mp3/51bc2cadfcfff240bf0032fb.mp3,a private vehicle huh no a taxi is okay
mp3/51bc2cadfcfff240bf0032fc.mp3,some people find a limo to be much more comfortable than a taxi
mp3/51bc2cadfcfff240bf0032fd.mp3,no i wouldn't be caught dead in a limo
mp3/51bc2cadfcfff240bf0032fe.mp3,all right no upgrade of any kind and where might you be going
mp3/51bc2cadfcfff240bf003300.mp3,when shall i tell the taxi to be here

mp3/51bc2fcdfcfff2dbba008e29.mp3,is there a swimming pool in this hotel
mp3/51bc2fcdfcfff2dbba008e2a.mp3,we don't have a full-sized swimming pool but we do have individual swim stations
mp3/51bc2fcdfcfff2dbba008e2c.mp3,basically a swim station is like a treadmill except instead of running you swim
mp3/51bc2fcdfcfff2dbba008e2d.mp3,that sounds really neat is there an extra charge for these swim stations
mp3/51bc2fcdfcfff2dbba008e2e.mp3,if you're a registered guest you have free access to our swim stations
mp3/51bc2fcdfcfff2dbba008e2f.mp3,are the swim stations open 24 hours like the rest of the gym
mp3/51bc2fcdfcfff2dbba008e30.mp3,to conserve electricity the stations operate only from 6:00 am till 11:00 pm
mp3/51bc2fcdfcfff2dbba008e31.mp3,i'll go down there as soon as i can
mp3/51bc2fcdfcfff2dbba008e32.mp3,i don't think you'll be disappointed people really seem to like the swim stations
mp3/51bc3054fcfff240bf003427.mp3,can i help you with anything
mp3/51bc3054fcfff240bf003428.mp3,can i leave a package with you

mp3/51bc3177fcfff2ed710032b2.mp3,let's see it says that you were charged monday at 9:00 pm for the movie titanic
mp3/51bc3177fcfff2ed710032b3.mp3,that's absolutely wrong i was out exploring the city monday night
mp3/51bc3177fcfff2ed710032b4.mp3,okay let me see what i can do
mp3/51bc3177fcfff2ed710032b5.mp3,thank you i didn't think it would be this simple

mp3/51bc3177fcfff2ed710032b7.mp3,are you serious i have to pay \$2 for a movie i never watched
mp3/51bc3177fcfff2ed710032b8.mp3,unfortunately sir it's how the computer is programmed

mp3/51bc3177fcfff2ed710032ba.mp3,i'm sorry sir perhaps you'd like to write a letter to headquarters

mp3/51bc32c7fcfff2c38a0082ac.mp3,when a reservation is cancelled within 48 hours prior we do need to charge a cancellation fee

mp3/51c15c1afcfff2ecfd000561.mp3,will housekeeping still clean the room
mp3/51c15c1afcfff2ecfd000562.mp3,you can remove the sign when you leave the hotel or you can speak directly to the manager to arrange a time
mp3/51c15f23fcfff2326f000627.mp3,we're having a great time at this hotel i'd like to extend the stay
mp3/51c15f23fcfff2326f000629.mp3,today is sunday can we keep our same room until tuesday

mp3/51c160b5fcfff23cca000712.mp3,i'm sure this is terribly upsetting for you we'll do our best to find the perpetrator whoever he or she may be
mp3/51c160b5fcfff23cca000713.mp3,i want to see the manager immediately
mp3/51c2fad7fcfff2c99f00447e.mp3,i want to travel around the world starting next year in india but i have no idea what's in store for me
mp3/51c2fad7fcfff2c99f00447f.mp3,what do you already know about india
mp3/51c2fad7fcfff2c99f004481.mp3,then let me give you a rundown
mp3/51c2fad7fcfff2c99f004482.mp3,ha alright indian culture 101 break it down for me
mp3/51c2fad7fcfff2c99f004483.mp3,many indians are hindu so be careful about offering hamburgers to a local
mp3/51c2fad7fcfff2c99f004485.mp3,standards of hygiene are going to be a little different
mp3/51c2fad7fcfff2c99f004486.mp3,so i've heard do you think my hotel will have air con
mp3/51c2fb7afcfff22cb6005086.mp3,alright i've booked my hotels for india does all this look to be in order
mp3/51c2fb7afcfff22cb6005087.mp3,looks good so far but do you have a contingency plan
mp3/51c2fb7afcfff22cb6005089.mp3,well what if you can't find the hotel or it's been closed down
mp3/51c2fb7afcfff22cb600508a.mp3,you're right i should have a plan b
mp3/51c2fb7afcfff22cb600508b.mp3,i would suggest meeting up with a local do you know about couchsurfing
mp3/51c2fb7afcfff22cb600508c.mp3,yes isn't it a little dangerous though
mp3/51c2fb7afcfff22cb600508d.mp3,well you run the risk of meeting a few weirdos sure
mp3/51c2fb7afcfff22cb600508e.mp3,but it would be a nice way to see the true india in all its glory
mp3/51c2fb7afcfff22cb600508f.mp3,absolutely or you could start checking out websites for expats in india
mp3/51c2fb7afcfff22cb6005090.mp3,good idea i don't think i'd be able to figure it out on my own
mp3/51c2fb7afcfff22cb6005091.mp3,for a country like india you'll absolutely need a local to show you the ropes
mp3/51c2fc01fcfff24ba20037f4.mp3,yes this is delhi transport how may i help you
mp3/51c2fc01fcfff24ba20037f5.mp3,hi i just wanted to book transportation from the airport to my hotel
mp3/51c2fc01fcfff24ba20037f6.mp3,no problem sir what was the date of your arrival
mp3/51c2fc01fcfff24ba20037f8.mp3,okay and what kind of car did you want to book
mp3/51c2fc01fcfff24ba20037f9.mp3,i'll have a lot of luggage so do you have an suv or minivan
mp3/51c2fc01fcfff24ba20037fa.mp3,we have both the suv is a bit more expensive but more comfortable of course
mp3/51c2fc01fcfff24ba20037fc.mp3,great we will email you shortly with information on how to make a deposit
mp3/51c2fc01fcfff24ba20037fd.mp3,and will someone meet me at the airport
mp3/51c2fc01fcfff24ba20037fe.mp3,we have a few kiosks in the arrivals area you can't miss them
mp3/51c2fdd8fcfff2ff78004e0f.mp3,do you know anything about transportation in india
mp3/51c2fdd8fcfff2ff78004e10.mp3,traffic is a nightmare in delhi
mp3/51c2fdd8fcfff2ff78004e11.mp3,then what's the best way to get around
mp3/51c2fdd8fcfff2ff78004e12.mp3,for short distances a tuk-tuk is probably best
mp3/51c2fdd8fcfff2ff78004e13.mp3,oh you mean one of those auto rickshaws
mp3/51c2fdd8fcfff2ff78004e14.mp3,yeah exactly they might rip you off so you should be careful
mp3/51c2fdd8fcfff2ff78004e16.mp3,they don't even have doors i don't think they're for the faint of heart
mp3/51c2fdd8fcfff2ff78004e18.mp3,there is actually it's quite convenient
mp3/51c2fdd8fcfff2ff78004e19.mp3,i might have to stick to the metro then
mp3/51c2fdd8fcfff2ff78004e1a.mp3,yep that might be one of the few creature comforts from home that you'll recognize in india
mp3/51c2fe61fcfff2f54a0039f5.mp3,one thing i didn't take into account is the visa
mp3/51c2fe61fcfff2f54a0039f7.mp3,it's not as cut-and-dried as i thought it would be
mp3/51c2fe61fcfff2f54a0039f8.mp3,what do you need to submit
mp3/51c2fe61fcfff2f54a0039f9.mp3,well for starters there's proof of residence proof of funds proof of employment
mp3/51c2fe61fcfff2f54a0039fa.mp3,that's a lot of hassle maybe you should just quit while you're ahead
mp3/51c2fe61fcfff2f54a0039fb.mp3,and not go but i've done so much planning already
mp3/51c2fe61fcfff2f54a0039fc.mp3,maybe this is all an omen that something bad'll happen to you overseas
mp3/51c2fe61fcfff2f54a0039fe.mp3,i don't know you chose a difficult country for your first time abroad
mp3/51c2fe61fcfff2f54a0039ff.mp3,but think of how much life experience i'll get
mp3/51c2fe61fcfff2f54a003a00.mp3,you're right nothing ventured nothing gained
mp3/51c2ff40fcfff29059003512.mp3,so are you ready for your big trip
mp3/51c2ff40fcfff29059003513.mp3,ready as i'll ever be i'm a bit worried about culture shock though
mp3/51c2ff40fcfff29059003514.mp3,well yeah it's what a four-month stay culture shock is inevitable
mp3/51c2ff40fcfff29059003516.mp3,yep first you'll experience the honeymoon phase that's when everything is new and exciting to you
mp3/51c2ff40fcfff29059003517.mp3,i can see that happening i'd probably love the attention that the locals would lavish on a foreigner
mp3/51c2ff40fcfff29059003518.mp3,then there's what's called the negotiation stage this is when the new exciting things start really making you feel like an outsider
mp3/51c2ff40fcfff2905900351a.mp3,yep also things that are unacceptable in your country might be the norm in the new country
mp3/51c2ff40fcfff2905900351b.mp3,i have a feeling there's more stages to the process
mp3/51c2ff40fcfff2905900351c.mp3,we'll get to that another time i've gotta get going now
mp3/51c30062fcfff2ff78004f77.mp3,do you remember the conversation we were having about culture shock
mp3/51c30062fcfff2ff78004f78.mp3,i sure do where were we
mp3/51c30062fcfff2ff78004f79.mp3,we left off on the second stage you were going to tell me about the other stages
mp3/51c30062fcfff2ff78004f7a.mp3,right the third stage is called the adjustment phase this is as the name suggests when you adjust to the new culture
mp3/51c30062fcfff2ff78004f7b.mp3,so then that's as good as an outsider can hope for right
mp3/51c30062fcfff2ff78004f7c.mp3,not quite there's one more stage called the mastery phase any guesses as to what happens in this phase
mp3/51c30062fcfff2ff78004f7d.mp3,i'm guessing that in the mastery phase you start behaving like a local
mp3/51c30062fcfff2ff78004f7e.mp3,something like that in the mastery phase you begin to feel comfortable and can feel somewhat united with the culture
mp3/51c30062fcfff2ff78004f7f.mp3,so you mean if i stay in a country long enough i'll start to act like them too
mp3/51c30062fcfff2ff78004f80.mp3,sort of you might not have completely assimilated but you can coexist without a problem
mp3/51c301defcfff245340037bd.mp3,it just crossed my mind why don't you just come with me to india
mp3/51c301defcfff245340037bf.mp3,you have experience there you know the ropes why not
mp3/51c301defcfff245340037c0.mp3,oh please you know i can't if i had the money i'd go back in a heartbeat
mp3/51c301defcfff245340037c1.mp3,ah right plus you have your baby to take care of
mp3/51c301defcfff245340037c2.mp3,exactly but i wish you all the best
mp3/51c301defcfff245340037c3.mp3,i'm starting to get cold feet actually
mp3/51c301defcfff245340037c4.mp3,that's natural but there's no backing out now
mp3/51c301defcfff245340037c5.mp3,you're right my flight leaves tomorrow
mp3/51c301defcfff245340037c6.mp3,i wish you the best of luck
mp3/51c301defcfff245340037c8.mp3,congratulations felix honestly i think this'll be one of the watershed moments in your life
mp3/51c30285fcfff290590037a6.mp3,you're clenching the armrests like there's no tomorrow
mp3/51c30285fcfff290590037a7.mp3,i'll be all right once we're in the air taking off i don't like so much
mp3/51c30285fcfff290590037aa.mp3,i love traveling too much to fear flying
mp3/51c30285fcfff290590037ab.mp3,you've been around a lot then
mp3/51c30285fcfff290590037ae.mp3,rwanda iraq chernobyl dangerous places that most people wouldn't want to go
mp3/51c30285fcfff290590037af.mp3,umm okay and to what end
mp3/51c30285fcfff290590037b0.mp3,i was hoping you could tell me
mp3/51c30317fcfff2f54a003faf.mp3,so what do you think of india so far
mp3/51c30317fcfff2f54a003fb0.mp3,it's exciting different takes some getting used to
mp3/51c30317fcfff2f54a003fb1.mp3,if you could sum up india in one sentence what would you say
mp3/51c30317fcfff2f54a003fb2.mp3,hmmm i would say that india is a place that can't be summed up in a single sentence
mp3/51c30317fcfff2f54a003fb3.mp3,i agree glad to see we're on the same page
mp3/51c30317fcfff2f54a003fb4.mp3,i'm sure you have some stories to tell about your time in india
mp3/51c30317fcfff2f54a003fb5.mp3,not really nothing to write home about
mp3/51c30317fcfff2f54a003fb6.mp3,nothing no scams or moments of enlightenment
mp3/51c30317fcfff2f54a003fb7.mp3,i don't know not really i once tackled a pickpocket
mp3/51c30317fcfff2f54a003fb8.mp3,well that's more than i've done do tell
mp3/51c30317fcfff2f54a003fb9.mp3,there's not much to tell he tried to pick my pocket i noticed so i chased him and the rest is history
mp3/51c90445fcfff246090008ec.mp3,i ordered pizza from room service last night i was eating on the bed watching tv and the bed got terribly stained
mp3/51c90445fcfff246090008ed.mp3,oh that happens all the time
mp3/51c90445fcfff246090008ee.mp3,i still feel embarrassed it's a pretty big mess
mp3/51c90445fcfff246090008ef.mp3,i appreciate that you told me but trust me we've seen much worse we bleach our sheets
mp3/51c90445fcfff246090008f0.mp3,oh well is there anything i can do
mp3/51c90445fcfff246090008f1.mp3,honestly if you want to be very kind just take the sheets off the bed and put them in a ball in the corner
mp3/51c90445fcfff246090008f2.mp3,should i try to clean the mess myself
mp3/51c90445fcfff246090008f3.mp3,oh no especially don't use the towels those are harder to clean than the sheets
mp3/51c90445fcfff246090008f4.mp3,okay that's a relief thanks so much
mp3/51c904f0fcfff2471f000cc2.mp3,can i help you look for anything

mp3/51c904f0fcfff2471f000ccb.mp3,please don't be offended but she'll think that's tacky
mp3/51c904f0fcfff2471f000ccc.mp3,how about a gift of soap or candles it's a small useful gift

mp3/51c90fe4fcfff2cd42000f0a.mp3,i think we'll just stay in motels along the way
mp3/51c90fe4fcfff2cd42000f0c.mp3,not really just because motels are smaller and cheaper than hotels i don't think they are any less safe than hotels
mp3/51c90fe4fcfff2cd42000f0d.mp3,just curious i have a friend who worked the night shift at a motel he saw some shady characters enter
mp3/51c90fe4fcfff2cd42000f0e.mp3,we're trying to save money most motels are clean and cheap even if they don't have a lot of amenities
mp3/51c90fe4fcfff2cd42000f0f.mp3,okay just keep your wits about you

mp3/51cd4f70fcfff2d87b000217.mp3,she was determined to keep me on track and that didn't include me becoming a father at eighteen

mp3/51cd524ffcfff28e00000238.mp3,nothing solid to go on just yet
mp3/51cd524ffcfff28e00000239.mp3,maybe you should withdraw the reward just let the police handle this
mp3/51cd524ffcfff28e0000023b.mp3,because you don't need to be fielding calls from every crackpot in town who's just looking for money
mp3/51cd524ffcfff28e0000023c.mp3,look all i need is one to tell me the truth
mp3/51cd524ffcfff28e0000023d.mp3,how are you gonna know if they're for real or if they just want a reward
mp3/51cd524ffcfff28e0000023e.mp3,i can tell when someone's lying can you
mp3/51cd52d2fcfff2f91f0002c7.mp3,what is that supposed to mean
mp3/51cd52d2fcfff2f91f0002c8.mp3,why do you think your mom took this case
mp3/51cd52d2fcfff2f91f0002c9.mp3,because she has a reason to believe that garrett's innocent
mp3/51cd52d2fcfff2f91f0002ca.mp3,or maybe she just doesn't want to see the precious hastings name get tarnished
mp3/51cd52d2fcfff2f91f0002cb.mp3,you think that she's trying to protect someone
mp3/51cd52d2fcfff2f91f0002cc.mp3,i think your mom has an agenda that has nothing to do with criminal defense
mp3/51cd538efcfff264a700070f.mp3,what do you say we try to find the grown-up beverages
mp3/51cd538efcfff264a7000710.mp3,don't kill the messenger but they're not serving alcohol

mp3/51cd538efcfff264a7000712.mp3,if not would you settle for a root beer
mp3/51cd538efcfff264a7000713.mp3,do you think it will ferment if we let it stand long enough
mp3/51cd54f6fcfff2bd5900027a.mp3,i didn't feel like leaving another message why are you avoiding me
mp3/51cd54f6fcfff2bd5900027c.mp3,i know there wasn't anyone hounding hanna at that church dance why did you lie
mp3/51cd54f6fcfff2bd5900027f.mp3,jason wants to prove garrett guilty
mp3/51cd54f6fcfff2bd59000280.mp3,yeah but he ended up doing the opposite
mp3/51cd54f6fcfff2bd59000281.mp3,well i'm not giving up he is guilty
mp3/51cd62dafcfff2003d000168.mp3,and you're sure of this there was a time when you thought i murdered alison remember
mp3/51cd55dafcfff2bd59000292.mp3,busy but they did take me off of cappuccino probation so
mp3/51cd55dafcfff2bd59000295.mp3,what do you think i got it for jenna i knew it i suck at buying gifts

mp3/51cebe94fcfff2946d0002a4.mp3,he might but he's not here because we just had our lowest sales year ever so i suppose what i think matters most right now
mp3/51cebe94fcfff2946d0002a7.mp3,what kind of people do you want
mp3/51cebe94fcfff2946d0002a8.mp3,people who are coming to the store because it is expensive
mp3/51cebf41fcfff2de7a000367.mp3,we obviously have very different ideas
mp3/51cebf41fcfff2de7a000368.mp3,gentlemen i really thought you could do better than this
mp3/51cebf41fcfff2de7a000369.mp3,people are going to come to some store they've never been to because it's more expensive
mp3/51cec028fcfff2946d0002b2.mp3,so you're going to ply me with drinks and convince me what a terrible mistake i'm making
mp3/51cec028fcfff2946d0002b4.mp3,you got in trouble didn't you
mp3/51cec028fcfff2946d0002b5.mp3,i shouldn't have lost my temper
mp3/51cec028fcfff2946d0002b8.mp3,now i do it was uh refreshing really i mean actually hearing all the things i always assumed people were thinking

mp3/51cec123fcfff27a1f000303.mp3,the view's okay now this is my favorite part of the store
mp3/51cec123fcfff27a1f000304.mp3,how did they get the penthouse
mp3/51cec123fcfff27a1f000305.mp3,it's the only way to make sure there isn't anyone hiding in the store at night
mp3/51cec123fcfff27a1f000306.mp3,well they know i'm with you right
mp3/51cec123fcfff27a1f000307.mp3,carla and leona i used to talk to them every night for a little girl a dog can be all you need

mp3/51cec4e9fcfff28e6e000043.mp3,i'd hate for you to miss the blackberries
mp3/51cec4e9fcfff28e6e000044.mp3,trudy found an apartment that she likes

mp3/51cec6f9fcfff2f2a5000031.mp3,why didn't you choose another one
mp3/51cec6f9fcfff2f2a5000033.mp3,as opposed to the other girls
mp3/51cec7c5fcfff2d7400000a2.mp3,you either have or you haven't i went a couple of times with my uncle new hampshire
mp3/51cec7c5fcfff2d7400000a3.mp3,i saw my cousin shoot a rabbit by coney island
mp3/51cec87ffcfff270e9000073.mp3,couldn't you just pretend all i wanted was for you to be discreet she lives on our block
mp3/51cec87ffcfff270e9000075.mp3,we're done peter this is over

mp3/51cec965fcfff2fff1000005.mp3,mr draper do you have some kind of surprise for the tobacco people
mp3/51cec965fcfff2fff1000007.mp3,if you're planning to continue with medical testimony
mp3/51cec965fcfff2fff1000008.mp3,the medical thing is dead we understand that
mp3/51cec965fcfff2fff1000009.mp3,yes dead an apt choice of words considering the public is convinced that cigarettes are poisonous
mp3/51cec965fcfff2fff100000a.mp3,so basically if you love danger you'll love smoking i just don't see that on a billboard
mp3/51d282c6fcfff2c56e0011fe.mp3,today i'd like to do a rundown on our upcoming product line i believe it represents a paradigm shift in the market
mp3/51d282c6fcfff2c56e001200.mp3,this new product disrupts the status quo and will be two years ahead of our competitors technology
mp3/51d282c6fcfff2c56e001201.mp3,wow this sounds like a real game changer
mp3/51d282c6fcfff2c56e001203.mp3,when do you expect to roll out this new product
mp3/51d282c6fcfff2c56e001204.mp3,my team plans to have this product ready to ship by q3 2016
mp3/51d282c6fcfff2c56e001205.mp3,that's excellent so we can start shipping units in time for the big christmas buying spree
mp3/51d282c6fcfff2c56e001206.mp3,exactly we'll do a big marketing push in the fall to really spread the word about the product
mp3/51d28376fcfff2678d0013d4.mp3,do you have a minute to circle with me
mp3/51d28376fcfff2678d0013d5.mp3,i'm actually running off to a meeting right now let's walk and talk
mp3/51d28376fcfff2678d0013d6.mp3,okay i was hoping you could take a look at my deck
mp3/51d28376fcfff2678d0013d9.mp3,okay i'm pretty swamped at the moment so could i take a look at it over the weekend
mp3/51d28376fcfff2678d0013da.mp3,yeah no problem do you have time to circle back around on monday
mp3/51d28376fcfff2678d0013db.mp3,sure thing let's sync up on monday
mp3/51d283eefcfff261e50011e1.mp3,hey tim are you ready for the product launch in two weeks
mp3/51d283eefcfff261e50011e2.mp3,yeah it's pretty stressful but i'm amped
mp3/51d283eefcfff261e50011e4.mp3,yeah my team is really busy ramping up for the launch we're all working 12-hour days
mp3/51d283eefcfff261e50011e6.mp3,hopefully it'll pay off we've received solid feedback from our market research and testing
mp3/51d283eefcfff261e50011e8.mp3,yup fingers crossed that we have strong sales straight out of the gate
mp3/51d284a6fcfff2229a0016a1.mp3,oh let me hold the door for you
mp3/51d284a6fcfff2229a0016a2.mp3,thank you very much that's very kind of you
mp3/51d284a6fcfff2229a0016a3.mp3,absolutely it's not every day that i get to ride in the elevator with our company's ceo
mp3/51d284a6fcfff2229a0016a5.mp3,it's nice to meet you i'm john from product development if i may i'd like to share with you an idea i have
mp3/51d284a6fcfff2229a0016a7.mp3,lots of companies in our industry sell basically the same service i think we can give consumers better value
mp3/51d284a6fcfff2229a0016a8.mp3,oh really how do you propose we do that
mp3/51d284a6fcfff2229a0016a9.mp3,we need to build tighter strategic alliances with our partners this will allow us to scale operations and lower costs
mp3/51d284a6fcfff2229a0016aa.mp3,why haven't our competitors done this already
mp3/51d284a6fcfff2229a0016ab.mp3,we're one of the strongest players in the industry so we have more clout than others this is a huge competitive advantage
mp3/51d284a6fcfff2229a0016ac.mp3,well this is my floor i love your idea here's my card email me a proposal by next week and we'll go from there
mp3/51d284a6fcfff2229a0016ad.mp3,thank you ma'am i won't let you down
mp3/51d28532fcfff2c9c4001922.mp3,what did you see in the market last week
mp3/51d28532fcfff2c9c4001923.mp3,there was a lot of movement we were down 2.5 percent at the start of the week and ended the week up 3 percent
mp3/51d28532fcfff2c9c4001924.mp3,yeah i noticed that i think the fed's announcement improved investor confidence
mp3/51d28532fcfff2c9c4001925.mp3,absolutely the fed signaled it was keeping interest rates at the same level
mp3/51d28532fcfff2c9c4001926.mp3,i don't think people expected that
mp3/51d28532fcfff2c9c4001927.mp3,that's right it sparked a rally starting on wednesday that held on through the week
mp3/51d28532fcfff2c9c4001928.mp3,the consumer confidence index is coming out next week
mp3/51d28532fcfff2c9c4001929.mp3,that's always a big indicator of how things are going
mp3/51d28532fcfff2c9c400192a.mp3,this recession has definitely affected confidence negatively
mp3/51d28532fcfff2c9c400192b.mp3,yes but i think you'll see the consumer confidence index inching upwards
mp3/51d28532fcfff2c9c400192c.mp3,the last few months have been disappointing
mp3/51d28532fcfff2c9c400192d.mp3,that's true but they haven't been as disastrous as some economists had feared
mp3/51d285cffcfff2931e0014a9.mp3,hey jen i hear acme corp is a real winner what's the word
mp3/51d285cffcfff2931e0014ab.mp3,wow acme is trading around \$88 this morning
mp3/51d285cffcfff2931e0014ad.mp3,really why did you do that
mp3/51d285cffcfff2931e0014ae.mp3,i think it's going to be trending downward it just can't sustain these multiples
mp3/51d285cffcfff2931e0014af.mp3,really would you like to share perhaps it's time to short the stock
mp3/51d285cffcfff2931e0014b0.mp3,the price-earnings ratio is off the p/e ratio is 44 they can't sustain that
mp3/51d285cffcfff2931e0014b1.mp3,i'm glad i asked any other reasons to get out now
mp3/51d285cffcfff2931e0014b2.mp3,i've just read a report on a number of r&d issues that are brewing
mp3/51d285cffcfff2931e0014b3.mp3,ouch that's not good r&d is their bread and butter
mp3/51d285cffcfff2931e0014b4.mp3,that's why it's time to sell i predict a massive sell-off in the coming weeks
mp3/51d28657fcfff2891000133b.mp3,what are the technical specifications on this new model
mp3/51d28657fcfff2891000133c.mp3,just a moment let me get the owner's manual what would you like to know
mp3/51d28657fcfff2891000133d.mp3,let's start with the basics how about size and weight
mp3/51d28657fcfff2891000133e.mp3,okay the smartphone is 123 millimeters high 59 millimeters wide and 6 millimeters thick it weighs 80 grams
mp3/51d28657fcfff2891000133f.mp3,that's a lot of technology for such a small package
mp3/51d28657fcfff28910001340.mp3,yes it's got bluetooth and wi-fi
mp3/51d28657fcfff28910001341.mp3,how much will the model sell for
mp3/51d28657fcfff28910001342.mp3,it's going to retail for \$699
mp3/51d28657fcfff28910001343.mp3,that's with the standard two-year commitment right
mp3/51d28657fcfff28910001344.mp3,no actually this phone's going to be offered with a three-year contract
mp3/51d286f3fcfff2c9410016f7.mp3,tell me about our quarterly results i've heard our margins are up quite a bit
mp3/51d286f3fcfff2c9410016f8.mp3,yes there's been a sharp rise in national sales we're up almost 24 over last year 23.8 to be exact
mp3/51d286f3fcfff2c9410016f9.mp3,that sounds great do sales tell the whole story
mp3/51d286f3fcfff2c9410016fa.mp3,not really we've also drastically cut some of our operational expenses
mp3/51d286f3fcfff2c9410016fb.mp3,oh really which expenses have been reduced
mp3/51d286f3fcfff2c9410016fc.mp3,as our sales channels have expanded on the web we've kept all staff changes and searches on hold
mp3/51d286f3fcfff2c9410016fe.mp3,that's right in fact headquarters has reduced staff by more than 8
mp3/51d286f3fcfff2c9410016ff.mp3,i hope no one has been laid off
mp3/51d286f3fcfff2c941001700.mp3,no no a number of strong incentives were offered to encourage early retirement
mp3/51d286f3fcfff2c941001701.mp3,i hope the gains weren't achieved solely through drastic reductions in staff
mp3/51d28c98fcfff2229a0017e7.mp3,hi do you have a minute to chat tom
mp3/51d28c98fcfff2229a0017e8.mp3,sure come on in is there anything i can do for you
mp3/51d28c98fcfff2229a0017e9.mp3,okay well it's a bit difficult but i really feel that it's about time that i received a raise
mp3/51d28c98fcfff2229a0017ea.mp3,okay and why do you feel this way
mp3/51d28c98fcfff2229a0017eb.mp3,well i have been here now for three years and in that time i have made good progress
mp3/51d28c98fcfff2229a0017ec.mp3,right so you feel that you're on a low salary for your current position and current responsibilities right
mp3/51d28c98fcfff2229a0017ed.mp3,yeah i do believe that what i've contributed to the department over recent months means that i should be paid more
mp3/51d28c98fcfff2229a0017ee.mp3,okay well what kind of raise are you looking for
mp3/51d28c98fcfff2229a0017ef.mp3,well you know i think that 3 on top of the usual annual raise with inflation isn't too much to ask
mp3/51d28c98fcfff2229a0017f0.mp3,three percent hmmm well as you know i can't just give you a raise just like that let me discuss this with my higher-ups okay
mp3/51d28c98fcfff2229a0017f1.mp3,okay fine should i put this request in writing as well so we all have a record of this discussion
mp3/51d28c98fcfff2229a0017f2.mp3,yes that'd be a good idea email me and also copy it to human resources
mp3/51d28d48fcfff2931e001581.mp3,jim i was wondering if we could discuss our new marketing strategy for a moment
mp3/51d28d48fcfff2931e001582.mp3,certainly pam you know that i'm working with amy on changing our image don't you
mp3/51d28d48fcfff2931e001583.mp3,yes i think you'll make an excellent team how do you feel about the merchandise we're pushing
mp3/51d28d48fcfff2931e001584.mp3,in my opinion the products we're offering are fine however i think we should start expanding into the young adult market
mp3/51d28d48fcfff2931e001585.mp3,i totally agree who buys more products than twenty-somethings
mp3/51d28d48fcfff2931e001586.mp3,exactly we haven't been very successful in our branding efforts have we
mp3/51d28d48fcfff2931e001587.mp3,i'm not keen on changing our target audience but we certainly have to improve our brand image
mp3/51d28d48fcfff2931e001588.mp3,if we want to edge out our main competitor we're going to have to target customers at a younger age
mp3/51d28d48fcfff2931e001589.mp3,maybe but we also have to keep our competitive edge in quality
mp3/51d28d48fcfff2931e00158a.mp3,why don't we all get together for a discussion
mp3/51d28d48fcfff2931e00158b.mp3,let me know when your next meeting with amy is going to be i'd like to go over some of our restructuring ideas

mp3/51d2de9bfcfff2c9c4003554.mp3,are there other ways to get on a leaderboard
mp3/51d2de9bfcfff2c9c4003555.mp3,yes there are but you have to find out for yourself
mp3/51d2dee5fcfff24f1f00301a.mp3,each time you finish a quiz you get a score

mp3/51d2df4dfcfff2cd750039c4.mp3,still i would suggest that everybody studies for at least five minutes per day
mp3/51d2df4dfcfff2cd750039c5.mp3,i can study for five minutes per day
mp3/51d2df4dfcfff2cd750039c6.mp3,i bet you can whether you're waiting for the bus or standing in line there is always an opportunity to study

mp3/51d2df92fcfff2c941003035.mp3,oh great there must be lots of helpful information there
mp3/51d2df92fcfff2c941003036.mp3,yeah there is go take a look now
mp3/51d2dff2fcfff261e500340c.mp3,some english-learners are embarrassed to speak and make mistakes
mp3/51d2dff2fcfff261e500340d.mp3,that's a natural feeling liu li shuo is always patient so it's safe and okay to make mistakes
mp3/51d2dff2fcfff261e500340e.mp3,that's comforting because mistakes are a natural part of learning
mp3/51d2dff2fcfff261e500340f.mp3,yup the most important thing is that people have fun learning enjoy liu li shuo

mp3/51d3f0e8fcfff2678d005d20.mp3,how are you going to swing that
mp3/51d3f0e8fcfff2678d005d21.mp3,well it depends on whether i'm able to offer a discount we can make the quota but it just depends on the discount
mp3/51d3f0e8fcfff2678d005d22.mp3,so if you get the green light to offer a discount it's a done deal and you'll reach your quota right
mp3/51d3f0e8fcfff2678d005d23.mp3,yup that's it i have to offer my customers some incentive to place an order before the end of the quarter
mp3/51d3f0e8fcfff2678d005d24.mp3,when are you going to know whether you can offer a discount
mp3/51d3f0e8fcfff2678d005d25.mp3,that's just it there are a number of people involved in making this decision so i have to make some phone calls
mp3/51d3f0e8fcfff2678d005d26.mp3,it sounds like you've got your work cut out for you do you think you can pull it off
mp3/51d3f0e8fcfff2678d005d27.mp3,oh i've got to make this happen

mp3/51d40293fcfff2229a0063a4.mp3,well due to weak demand profits were 230 million dollars down 3 percent from q2
mp3/51d40293fcfff2229a0063a5.mp3,i see and what about the year-on-year comparison
mp3/51d40293fcfff2229a0063a6.mp3,compared to q3 last year profits were up a solid 12 percent
mp3/51d40293fcfff2229a0063a7.mp3,that's great can you drill down into those numbers a bit more and draft a report for me
mp3/51d40293fcfff2229a0063a8.mp3,sure thing you'll have something on your desk by week's end
mp3/51d40293fcfff2229a0063a9.mp3,sounds good after i take a look at your draft let's sync up next week

mp3/51d40484fcfff2d686005868.mp3,i agree the new brush-o-matic toothbrush should be a blockbuster
mp3/51d40484fcfff2d686005869.mp3,our designers have already made up some prototypes the toothbrushes have all kinds of bells and whistles
mp3/51d40484fcfff2d68600586a.mp3,we should fast-track this project let's try to launch it in time for the holiday season
mp3/51d40484fcfff2d68600586b.mp3,this would be a great stocking stuffer
mp3/51d40484fcfff2d68600586c.mp3,we definitely need a big win for the holidays
mp3/51d40484fcfff2d68600586d.mp3,this is a great idea we're going to make a killing
mp3/51d40484fcfff2d68600586e.mp3,let's not talk about this project to anybody who doesn't need to know we'll keep it under wraps
mp3/51d40484fcfff2d68600586f.mp3,i agree mum's the word we don't want any of our competitors to get wind of the idea and rip it off
mp3/51d40484fcfff2d686005870.mp3,right let's meet again on monday morning and discuss our game plan for getting this project off the ground

mp3/51d408d0fcfff2c941005d83.mp3,oh i see what's a bill of lading
mp3/51d408d0fcfff2c941005d84.mp3,the bill of lading lists the merchandise shipped it's included with every shipment or delivery
mp3/51d408d0fcfff2c941005d85.mp3,i get what prepaid means that means the merchandise has been paid for but what's c.o.d
mp3/51d408d0fcfff2c941005d88.mp3,exactly what it says cash is paid upon receiving the goods of course it could be a credit card or a check as well
mp3/51d408d0fcfff2c941005d89.mp3,oh i understand what's a delivery fee
mp3/51d408d0fcfff2c941005d8a.mp3,the delivery fee is an extra charge that the customer pays to have the goods delivered
mp3/51d408d0fcfff2c941005d8b.mp3,i think i'm beginning to get the hang of it thanks
mp3/51d409b3fcfff24f1f005a86.mp3,can we go over some figures please
mp3/51d409b3fcfff24f1f005a87.mp3,yes our shareholders meeting is soon i think it'd be a good idea to review the key numbers

mp3/51d409b3fcfff24f1f005a8a.mp3,what percentage of that is research and development

mp3/51d409b3fcfff24f1f005a90.mp3,that's impressive that's up from last year isn't it about 10 points i think
mp3/51d409b3fcfff24f1f005a91.mp3,that's right we're solidly in the black as a matter of fact this is our fifth year straight
mp3/51d409b3fcfff24f1f005a93.mp3,they should be this kind of growth in the current market is remarkable

mp3/51d40b68fcfff2d686005a91.mp3,it seems too much to me
mp3/51d40b68fcfff2d686005a92.mp3,remember that computer equipment tends to depreciate faster than office furniture
mp3/51d40b68fcfff2d686005a93.mp3,i guess so i'll take your word for it did they approve the balance

mp3/51d40e48fcfff28910005ffd.mp3,sounds like a win-win how long is the ramp-up
mp3/51d40e48fcfff28910005ffe.mp3,that's the problem i projected a roll-out in two months c-level people want to dial-in the project in two weeks
mp3/51d40e48fcfff28910005fff.mp3,but you're proposing an end-to-end solution
mp3/51d40e48fcfff28910006000.mp3,yeah i know i had the time-frame mapped out for all the deliverables too
mp3/51d40e48fcfff28910006001.mp3,sometimes you have to wonder about high-level management's capabilities to leverage people like you

mp3/51d40e48fcfff28910006003.mp3,nothing much i just wanted to give you a heads-up on some management issues i've been having with pete

mp3/51d4e72cfcfff29c33000c4d.mp3,funny you should ask we're trying to figure that one out too
mp3/51d4e72cfcfff29c33000c4f.mp3,i mean we're still ideating our team just had a huge brain dump last week
mp3/51d4e72cfcfff29c33000c51.mp3,haha sorry i mean we're still forming our ideas and we just shared all of our thoughts
mp3/51d4e72cfcfff29c33000c52.mp3,aha got it well all the best as you ideate
mp3/51d4e72cfcfff29c33000c53.mp3,thanks feel free to toss any ideas my way
mp3/51d4e7c4fcfff2bcf2000a08.mp3,hey chelsea how's your new app coming along
mp3/51d4e7c4fcfff2bcf2000a09.mp3,it's going well we just finished our beta and we're about to go into testing
mp3/51d4e7c4fcfff2bcf2000a0a.mp3,that sounds cool but what's a beta
mp3/51d4e7c4fcfff2bcf2000a0b.mp3,oh a beta is a trial version of a product it might still have lots of bugs and isn't ready for consumers
mp3/51d4e7c4fcfff2bcf2000a0c.mp3,oh i see so it's like a prototype
mp3/51d4e7c4fcfff2bcf2000a0d.mp3,yup that's exactly what it is
mp3/51d4e7c4fcfff2bcf2000a0e.mp3,cool so how are you going to conduct your beta test
mp3/51d4e7c4fcfff2bcf2000a0f.mp3,that's a great question we're making the beta available to a small group of our hardcore users
mp3/51d4e7c4fcfff2bcf2000a10.mp3,smart so you're going to crowdsource your test
mp3/51d4e7c4fcfff2bcf2000a11.mp3,yeah we have really dedicated users who are eager to try out our latest version and also give us feedback
mp3/51d4e7c4fcfff2bcf2000a12.mp3,sounds like a win-win for you and your users
mp3/51d4e865fcfff29c33000c5d.mp3,so how did your beta test go chelsea
mp3/51d4e865fcfff29c33000c5e.mp3,well we got a lot of user feedback but the results were mixed
mp3/51d4e865fcfff29c33000c60.mp3,most users who tested our beta version liked the app's new functionality
mp3/51d4e865fcfff29c33000c62.mp3,but a lot of testers thought the new user interface was unintuitive they found the new ui really difficult to use
mp3/51d4e865fcfff29c33000c63.mp3,well i guess it's good that you got that feedback now instead of after you rolled out the new version right
mp3/51d4e865fcfff29c33000c64.mp3,haha yeah every cloud has a silver lining
mp3/51d4e865fcfff29c33000c65.mp3,yeah you're right every bad situation does have something good in it
mp3/51d4e865fcfff29c33000c66.mp3,yup this was a learning experience and we'll be able to incorporate the user feedback in our final version
mp3/51d4e8fdfcfff2cd03000e21.mp3,what happened to d & h petroleum
mp3/51d4e8fdfcfff2cd03000e24.mp3,that doesn't surprise me there is a rumor going around that their ceo is being investigated for fraud
mp3/51d4e8fdfcfff2cd03000e25.mp3,oh that's right i heard some whispers about that too
mp3/51d4e8fdfcfff2cd03000e28.mp3,acme shares jumped 8 percent and hit an all-time high in intra-day trading
mp3/51d4e8fdfcfff2cd03000e29.mp3,oh yes there's some speculation that their new drug is about to get final approval for sale
mp3/51d4e8fdfcfff2cd03000e2a.mp3,now the price jump makes sense
mp3/51d4ea28fcfff2d34e0009e4.mp3,hi stephen do you have a minute to meet in my office
mp3/51d4ea28fcfff2d34e0009e6.mp3,as you know with the recent market downturn we've had to slash our budget
mp3/51d4ea28fcfff2d34e0009e7.mp3,yeah our whole team has felt it
mp3/51d4ea28fcfff2d34e0009e8.mp3,unfortunately we now have to make cuts to personnel and i have to let you go at the end of the month
mp3/51d4ea28fcfff2d34e0009e9.mp3,whoa i know times have been tough but i wasn't expecting any downsizing
mp3/51d4ea28fcfff2d34e0009ea.mp3,things happened pretty quickly and i know this must be tough news to receive
mp3/51d4ea28fcfff2d34e0009eb.mp3,yeah i don't know what i'm going to do next what is there in the way of severance
mp3/51d4ea28fcfff2d34e0009ec.mp3,that's a good question we've prepared a six-month package with full pay and full health benefits
mp3/51d4ea28fcfff2d34e0009ed.mp3,okay hopefully that'll give me enough time to get back on my feet
mp3/51d4ea28fcfff2d34e0009ee.mp3,thanks again for your contributions to our team stephen i wish you all the best
mp3/51d4eab3fcfff29c33000c8b.mp3,as you know we're having this press conference due to a recent recall of our product i'll now open it up to questions
mp3/51d4eab3fcfff29c33000c8c.mp3,as coo of the company what was your role in production oversight why did it take so long to find this defect
mp3/51d4eab3fcfff29c33000c8d.mp3,i'm here to comment on the recall rather than focus on specific roles or point fingers

mp3/51d4eab3fcfff29c33000c93.mp3,there is an ongoing internal review of our suppliers and new safety procedures are being implemented
mp3/51d4eab3fcfff29c33000c94.mp3,there is speculation that a class action suit will be brought against your company your thoughts

mp3/51d4eb55fcfff23259000d99.mp3,i think sales teams are working in silos so we have to streamline our communications
mp3/51d4eb55fcfff23259000d9a.mp3,what do you think has caused the sudden decline in sales
mp3/51d4eb55fcfff23259000d9b.mp3,to tell you the truth i'm concerned about market saturation
